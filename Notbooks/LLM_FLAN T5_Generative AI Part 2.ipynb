    "### 2.2 - Preparing Reward Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In Reinforcement Learning (RL), I engage with environments to maximize cumulative rewards through actions. My behavior, known as the policy, dictates this interaction. The aim is to learn an optimal or near-optimal policy maximizing the reward function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous section](#2.1), my initial policy relied on the instruct PEFT model, essentially the LLM before detoxification. I could solicit feedback from human labelers on the toxicity of the outputs. However, this approach can be costly for the entire fine-tuning process. To mitigate this, I propose using a reward model to incentivize detoxification of dialogue summaries. An intuitive strategy involves performing sentiment analysis with two classes (`nothate` and `hate`) and granting higher rewards for outputs classified as `nothate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, I'll utilize feedback generated by Meta AI's RoBERTa-based hate speech model, available [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/roberta-hate-speech-dynabench-r4-target). This model generates logits, which are then used to predict probabilities across the two classes. Logits indicating `nothate` will be considered positive rewards. Subsequently, I'll fine-tune the model using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with these reward values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, I'll instantiate the necessary model class for the RoBERTa model. Additionally, I'll load a tokenizer to evaluate the model. It's important to note that label `0` corresponds to class `nothate`, while label `1` corresponds to class `hate`."
