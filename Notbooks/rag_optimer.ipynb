      "[[Document(metadata={}, page_content='# Navigating the Three-Part Interview Process\\n\\nThe interview process has remained relatively unchanged for generations, and while it continues to be a crucial part of hiring, understanding the structure can significantly help job seekers know what to expect. More importantly, it helps you know when to emphasize specific aspects of your background. There’s often a misconception that if you impress the HR team, you’re well on your way to landing the job. But in reality, that’s only one part of the process. Let’s break the interview process down into three major components: **HR, the Hiring Team, and Senior Leadership**. ### **Part 1: The HR Interview**\\n\\nOnce your resume passes the [**Applicant Tracking System**](https://opt-imize.com/blog/creating-an-ats-friendly-resume/) **(ATS)**, the first person to contact you is often someone from the HR team—typically a recruiter or HR coordinator. At this stage, HR’s role is less about evaluating your technical expertise and more about assessing your general fit for the company. HR professionals rarely have in-depth knowledge about the specific job requirements, but they are looking to understand how you might fit into the company’s culture, if you have the right work authorization, and your general work preferences (remote, hybrid, in-office). **What HR Focuses On**:\\n\\n- Your work style and how you might fit into the team dynamic. - Basic qualifications like work authorization status and general understanding of the company.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='- Your general background and career trajectory. Many candidates believe that acing this first interview guarantees them the job, but that’s a mistake. HR’s role is to screen for basic qualifications and cultural fit, not to make the final hiring decision. Think of this as a **gateway interview**—you need to show you’re a good match to move forward, but this is just the first step in a longer process. #### **Example Questions HR Might Ask:**\\n\\n1. **“Tell me about yourself.”**\\n    - **How to Answer**: Give a brief professional summary focusing on your career trajectory and your interest in the role. Avoid diving deep into technical details. - **Example**: “I’ve been working in marketing for over five years, focusing on digital campaigns and SEO strategy. I’ve developed a passion for helping brands grow their online presence, and I’m excited about the opportunity to bring that expertise to your team.”\\n2. **“Why do you want to work at this company?”**\\n    - **How to Answer**: Research the company ahead of time and mention specific aspects that align with your values or career goals. - **Example**: “I’m really drawn to your company’s focus on innovation in the e-commerce space.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='I’ve followed your recent projects, and I admire how you’re staying ahead of trends.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='I feel my background in marketing automation could help continue driving those innovations forward.”\\n3. **“What is your work authorization status?”**\\n    - **How to Answer**: Be honest and clear about your work status. If you require sponsorship, make sure to mention it early on to avoid confusion later. - **Example**: “I am currently on an F-1 visa with OPT, and I would need sponsorship for an H-1B visa down the line.”\\n\\n### **Part 2: The Hiring Team Interview**\\n\\nThis is where the real evaluation happens. Once you pass the HR screening, you’ll meet with the **hiring manager** and, in some cases, additional team members. This part of the interview process can be more in-depth, depending on the complexity of the role, and it could involve several rounds or interviews with different team members. **Why this Stage is Critical**:  \\nThis is the part where decisions get made. The hiring team has the power to decide if you’re the right fit for the role. Whether it’s a one-on-one interview with the hiring manager or a panel interview with various team members, this is where you’ll need to demonstrate how your skills align with the job. If you’re interviewing for a **technical role**, this is where **projects** and **certifications** come into play. Hiring managers are looking for evidence that you can deliver on the specific technical skills the job requires. For example, if a company is about to implement a new CRM system and you have direct experience leading a CRM implementation, that makes you a top candidate right away. On the other hand, if you’re applying for a **non-technical role**, your **experience** takes center stage. Whether it’s managing teams, driving sales, or leading projects, the hiring team is most interested in how you’ve contributed to previous organizations. Here, it’s all about demonstrating **leadership**, **problem-solving**, and **teamwork**. #### **Example Questions the Hiring Team Might Ask:**\\n\\n1. **“Can you walk us through a project where you implemented \\\\[specific skill\\\\]?”**\\n    - **How to Answer**: Provide a concise, yet detailed explanation of a relevant project. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to keep your answer structured. - **Example**: “In my previous role, we were tasked with migrating our CRM system to a cloud-based solution.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='I led a team of five, coordinated with IT, and successfully transitioned our data to Salesforce, reducing operational costs by 15%.”\\n2. **“How do you handle tight deadlines or competing priorities?”**\\n    - **How to Answer**: Highlight your time management and prioritization skills, giving a specific example of how you handled a high-pressure situation. - **Example**: “I always start by breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. For example, during a product launch, I created a priority matrix to ensure all essential elements were completed first, which helped us launch on time despite a tight schedule.”\\n3. **“Why are you the right fit for this role?”**\\n    - **How to Answer**: Focus on how your experience aligns with the job requirements, and emphasize how you can add value to the team. - **Example**: “My experience with data-driven marketing campaigns aligns perfectly with the goals outlined in the job description. I’ve increased lead generation by 30% in my previous roles and am confident I can bring similar success to your team.”\\n\\n### **Part 3: The Senior Leadership Interview**\\n\\nThe final step is often a meeting with senior leadership. While the hiring manager and team may have already decided that you’re the best fit for the role, senior leadership’s job is to ensure that you’re aligned with the company’s broader vision and culture. At this stage, the focus is less on your technical abilities or past experience and more on **how you’ll fit into the team and the company’s culture**. Senior leaders are looking for someone who can be trusted, who will fit well into the team, and who shows potential for growth. It’s crucial to show that you’re a team player, reliable, and capable of taking on leadership responsibilities when needed. #### **Example Questions Senior Leadership Might Ask:**\\n\\n1. **“What do you see as the biggest challenge in this role, and how would you address it?”**\\n    - **How to Answer**: Demonstrate your understanding of the role’s demands and your proactive approach to problem-solving. - **Example**: “The biggest challenge will be integrating the new CRM system smoothly across all departments. My approach would be to create clear timelines and ensure frequent communication between teams to address any issues early.”\\n2. **“How do you envision yourself growing with the company?”**\\n    - **How to Answer**: Show that you’re thinking about your long-term career and how it aligns with the company’s future. - **Example**: “I see myself growing into a leadership role where I can mentor newer team members while continuing to drive innovation within the marketing department. I’m committed to contributing to the company’s long-term success.”\\n3. **“Why do you believe you’re the right cultural fit for our organization?”**\\n    - **How to Answer**: Demonstrate that you’ve done your homework on the company culture and explain how your values align with theirs. - **Example**: “I’ve been impressed by your commitment to innovation and team collaboration, both of which are values I hold strongly. In my previous roles, I’ve always encouraged open communication and creative problem-solving, which I believe fits well with your team’s dynamic.”\\n\\n### **Understanding the Interview Process Can Make All the Difference**\\n\\nThe interview process is more than just answering questions—it’s about knowing **when** to say the right things and **to whom**. Each stage of the interview process has a distinct purpose, and understanding those differences is crucial for your success. 1. **HR Interview**: This is all about making sure you’re a good fit for the company on a basic level. Don’t overthink it—just be yourself and make sure you meet their basic criteria. 2. **Hiring Team Interview**: This is the most critical stage where you need to align your skills and experience with the specific job requirements. Tailor your responses to the job description, focusing on projects (for technical roles) or leadership and experience (for non-technical roles). 3. **Senior Leadership Interview**: Here, it’s about fitting into the broader company culture. Demonstrate that you’re a reliable, trustworthy, and collaborative team player who can grow within the company. This three-part structure is widely used in the industry, and while the number of interviews may vary, the basic principles remain the same. By tailoring your approach to each phase and preparing for the types of questions asked at each stage, you’ll be in a much stronger position to succeed in the interview process and land the job. ')], [Document(metadata={}, page_content='# Shifting Trends in U.S. Higher Education Enrollment\\n\\nThe United States has historically been a top destination for students, driven by opportunities for research, professional advancement, and sociocultural engagement. Particularly in the last few years, the experiences of international students in the US have become a microcosm of changing rhetoric toward immigrants, the effects of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.boundless.com/research/international-students-studying-in-the-united-states-trends-and-impacts/), and perceptions of the United States on a global stage. However, the [data shows](https://educationdata.org/college-enrollment-statistics#international) that in 2023, 15.2 million students were enrolled in undergraduate programs, and roughly 3.1 million were enrolled in graduate-level programs, bringing total enrollment to 18.3 million students. This marks a significant drop from 2010, when enrollment exceeded 21 million each year. Additionally, the data highlights a notable trend: a significant decline in undergraduate program enrollments and a slight increase in graduate program enrollments. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd_EDbFDL0kgAnFsSPcr6aOUjPGgOnoVkAQK_l-Q45MXiDdvo9bNORc9W8mhSyPk6gNF5rRlN8rH5DJsFPRT6ioi1St9VNl3zRRDyagYEEKVpGUTuRp5uLPfn-i7oSQHmfvi0teTgmcK1SNRXlbfqHWr9-p?key=EEQQCx0Svvbs5xeRg9GwLQ)\\n\\n## Reasons for Decline in Undergraduate Enrollment:\\n\\n- Demographic Shifts: The population of college-aged individuals has been declining. Birth rates fell during the Great Recession of 2008, which has now resulted in fewer high school graduates. - Economic Factors: Rising tuition costs and student debt have deterred potential students from enrolling in undergraduate programs. According to the College Board, the average tuition and fees for the 2023-2024 academic year ranged from $10,560 at public four-year in-state institutions to $39,400 at private nonprofit four-year institutions . - Alternative Education Pathways: There’s an increasing trend towards vocational training, online courses, and other forms of education that do not require traditional college enrollment.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The rise of platforms like Coursera, Udacity, and Khan Academy supports this shift. ### Increase in Graduate Program Enrollment:\\n\\n- Career Advancement: Many individuals see graduate education as a way to advance their careers, especially in a competitive job market. A report from the Council of Graduate Schools indicated that graduate enrollment increased by 3.5% from Fall 2020 to Fall 2021 . - Lifelong Learning: There’s a growing emphasis on lifelong learning, with professionals returning to school to update their skills or switch careers. This trend has been accelerated by technological advancements and changing job requirements. ## Impact on Higher Education Institutions:\\n\\n- Strategic Adjustments: Colleges and universities are adjusting their strategies to attract and retain students. This includes expanding online program offerings, improving financial aid packages, and enhancing support services for students. - Focus on Graduate Programs: Institutions are investing more in their graduate programs to cater to the increasing demand, which includes creating more specialized programs and partnerships with industries. ## International Enrollments\\n\\nIn contrast to domestic trends, the international student population in the United States has grown year over year, reaching an all-time high just before the COVID-19 pandemic. For decades, the number of international students in the U.S. [steadily climbed](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/international-student-enrollment-statistics/), with the five years leading up to the pandemic seeing over 1 million international students annually. The peak came in 2018, with just over 1,095,000 students, comprising roughly 872,000 enrolled students and 223,000 participating in Optional Practical Training (OPT). The significant rise in students engaging in OPT since the early 2000s reflects the increasing opportunities in the U.S., particularly in fields such as engineering and data analysis. However, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted dramatic declines in international student enrollment. Travel restrictions, visa processing delays, and shifts to online learning all contributed to a sharp drop. Despite these challenges, there were signs of a rebound just a year later. For the 2021-22 academic year, with most colleges nationwide planning for in-person learning, 43% of institutions reported an increase in international student applications compared to 2020 levels. Graduate programs proved even more popular, with nearly 60% of schools noting a rise in international applications. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdqnwH-hmZoHQpAv2-MXBx8hbPxiU3ieXfQgBUevTfE5PzZ-R_OHOEd1bkSCzyP0VBD0D-zQ1vfXJQLW9Dq1mC1Sn7ZyNxPF8PHQXkQZU9M6Wj9K8ne5N4s4JD4nJn65upyxDLMGtcXTHfg6PBv5j6_1Iw0?key=EEQQCx0Svvbs5xeRg9GwLQ)\\n\\n## The Rise and Importance of OPT\\n\\nOptional Practical Training (OPT) has become increasingly popular among international students in recent years. OPT allows international students on F-1 visas to work in the United States for up to 12 months, or up to 36 months for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) graduates, following the completion of their academic programs. [Several factors](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/old_uploads/2019/03/OPT.pdf) contribute to the rise in OPT participation and its growing importance:\\n\\n1. Career Advancement: OPT provides international students with valuable work experience in their fields of study, enhancing their resumes and increasing their competitiveness in the global job market. This experience is particularly crucial in high-demand sectors like engineering, data analysis, and technology.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='2. Financial Benefits: Many international students take out significant loans to cover the high cost of U.S. tuition. OPT allows them to work and earn money, helping them repay these loans and alleviate financial burdens. 3. Pathway to Permanent Residency: For some students, OPT serves as a stepping stone to longer-term employment in the U.S. and potential pathways to permanent residency. Employers who hire international graduates often sponsor them for H-1B visas, which can eventually lead to a green card. 4.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Industry Demand: The U.S. job market has a high demand for skilled workers, particularly in STEM fields. OPT enables employers to tap into a pool of highly educated and skilled international talent, addressing skill shortages and fostering innovation. 5. Institutional Support: U.S. colleges and universities actively support international students in securing OPT opportunities. Career services offices provide resources, workshops, and guidance to help students navigate the job market and maximize their OPT experience. ## Reasons for the Increase in International Enrollment and OPT Participation\\n\\n1. Quality of Education: The U.S. is home to many of the world’s top universities, offering high-quality education, cutting-edge research opportunities, and state-of-the-art facilities. This reputation attracts students from around the globe. 2. Global Networking: Studying in the U.S. provides international students with the opportunity to build a global network of peers, professors, and professionals. These connections can be invaluable for future career prospects and personal growth. 3. Cultural Exchange: The cultural diversity and inclusivity of U.S. campuses offer international students a unique experience of cultural exchange and personal development. Exposure to different perspectives and ideas enriches their academic journey.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='4. Economic Opportunities: The robust U.S. economy and dynamic job market present [numerous opportunities](https://www.businessroundtable.org/rebuilding-together/immigration/economic-impact-curbing-optional-practical-training-program) for international graduates. The potential for high-paying jobs and career growth makes the U.S. an attractive destination for higher education and professional training. 5. Government Initiatives: Various government initiatives and policies have supported the growth of international student enrollment. Efforts to streamline visa processes and enhance support services for international students contribute to this trend. As the global education landscape continues to recover from the pandemic, the resilience and appeal of U.S. higher education remain evident. Institutions are increasingly focused on welcoming international students, who bring diverse perspectives and contribute significantly to the academic and cultural fabric of campuses nationwide. The continued growth in OPT participation underscores the importance of practical work experience in shaping successful careers and fostering global talent exchange. ## Economic Benefits of Immigration and the OPT Program\\n\\nThe United States allows Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students due to the [substantial economic benefits](https://www.businessroundtable.org/rebuilding-together/immigration/economic-impact-curbing-optional-practical-training-program) it brings to the country. OPT serves as a critical bridge between academic training and practical employment, [providing advantages](https://www.fwd.us/news/immigration-facts-the-positive-economic-impact-of-immigration/) that extend beyond individual students to the broader economy. 1. Effects on Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\\n    - Increased Consumer Spending: Immigration infuses the economy with new consumers, thereby increasing total consumer spending. This is significant because consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic growth. Immigrants are not just consumers; they possess enormous spending power that drives the economy and creates employment opportunities for all Americans. In 2018, after contributing billions of dollars in state, local, and federal taxes, immigrants were left with $1.2 trillion in spending power, which they used to purchase goods and services, stimulating local business activity. - Labor Supply Boost: By increasing the supply of labor, immigration enhances overall economic output. International students and graduates entering the workforce contribute to a more dynamic and flexible labor market. The influx of skilled workers helps meet the demands of various industries, fostering economic resilience and growth. - Productivity and Innovation: Immigrants are often at the forefront of starting new businesses and developing new technologies. This entrepreneurial activity increases the productivity of capital and strengthens overall economic output. Immigrants are innovators and job creators, playing a crucial role in the economic landscape. For instance, immigrants added $2 trillion to the U.S. GDP in 2016 and $458.7 billion to state, local, and federal taxes in 2018. - GDP Growth: A 1 percent increase in the population of immigrants in the United States is associated with a 1.15 percent gain in GDP. This correlation highlights the positive impact of immigration on the nation’s economic health. The contributions of immigrants in terms of consumer spending, labor supply, productivity, and innovation collectively drive significant economic growth, underscoring the importance of supportive immigration policies. 2. Filling Skill Gaps:\\n    - STEM Contributions: Many international students are enrolled in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs. By participating in OPT, these students fill critical skill gaps in high-demand fields, fostering innovation and maintaining the U.S.’s competitive edge in technology and science. - Industry Demand: Industries facing labor shortages benefit from the influx of skilled international graduates. This helps companies grow and innovate, further boosting the economy.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='3. Entrepreneurial Activity:\\n    - Business Formation: Immigrants are more likely than native-born citizens to start their own businesses. These new enterprises create jobs, drive local economies, and contribute to a vibrant business ecosystem.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='4. Economic Multiplier Effect:\\n    - Community Impact: The presence of international students and their families generates significant economic activity in local communities, from housing and transportation to retail and services. This multiplier effect extends the economic benefits of OPT beyond just the labor market. By allowing OPT, the United States not only supports the academic and professional growth of international students but also leverages their potential to drive economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness. Integrating these students into the workforce is a strategic move that benefits the U.S. economy on multiple levels. As international students, understanding and capitalizing on these opportunities can help you make the most of your time in the U.S. However, it is important to be aware of the laws that protect the employment rights of native citizens. International students must adhere to specific regulations to successfully navigate the job market and achieve their professional goals. By following these rules, you can ensure a smooth and rewarding experience while contributing positively to the U.S. economy and society. ## Embarking on Your Educational Journey in the United States\\n\\nIf you have made the decision to study in the United States, congratulations!

Welcome to the next exciting chapter of your educational journey in the United States! ')], [Document(metadata={}, page_content='# Crafting the Perfect Resume Technical vs. Non-Technical Approaches\\n\\nThe job market has become increasingly competitive, and with more applications than ever flowing into companies, employers have turned to technology to streamline the hiring process. Enter the **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)**—a tool used by nearly every large company in the U.S. to manage and filter job applicants. So, if you want your resume to actually make it to the hands of a hiring manager, it’s critical to understand how to create an **ATS-friendly resume**. ## **What is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)?**\\n\\nAn [**Applicant Tracking System**](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/recruiting/what-is-applicant-tracking-system/) **(ATS)** is software designed to help employers manage candidates throughout the hiring process. It automates much of the recruitment process, from collecting resumes to filtering out applicants based on certain criteria. Today, 99% of Fortune 500 companies use an ATS to sort through the flood of resumes they receive daily. These systems help companies streamline their hiring, especially when faced with hundreds (or even thousands) of applicants per job posting. But while the ATS is a helpful tool for recruiters, it can be a frustrating barrier for job seekers. Many candidates fear their resumes will never make it past the ATS, meaning their skills and experience may never be seen by human eyes. Unfortunately, that fear isn’t entirely unfounded. ATS software scans resumes for specific keywords, phrases, and formatting. If your resume doesn’t match the job description closely enough, it can be automatically filtered out before it reaches a recruiter’s desk. ## **Why Do Employers Use ATS?**\\n\\nATS helps employers in several ways:\\n\\n- **Efficiency**: Sorting through hundreds of resumes manually is impossible for large companies. ATS automates this process, making recruitment faster. - **Standardization**: ATS ensures that only resumes that match the job description move forward in the hiring process, creating a more standardized way to evaluate candidates. - **Keyword Matching**: ATS uses algorithms to match resumes with keywords from the job description. Resumes with the right keywords rank higher, while others may be automatically rejected. While this sounds great for employers, it poses a challenge for job seekers who have to navigate this digital gatekeeper. Crafting an ATS-friendly resume is all about understanding how these systems work and making sure your resume plays by their rules. ## **ATS for Job Seekers: The Reality**\\n\\nFor job seekers, the reality is that ATS plays a big role in determining whether your resume is even seen by a human recruiter. Larger companies rely on these systems to filter out resumes that don’t match their criteria. While it may seem unfair that software is “judging” your qualifications, it’s a necessity for businesses handling hundreds of applications at a time. In my experience working with ATS systems, recruiters have plenty of customization options. They can input keywords, specific phrases, and even technical terms or university names to fine-tune the system’s filtering process. This means the system isn’t randomly filtering you out—it’s carefully matching your resume against the job description. But here’s the challenge: most resume creation tools that claim to make your resume “ATS-friendly” focus on broad industries, and that can be too generic. To really stand out, you need to tailor your resume to the specific job you’re applying for. Even though ATS systems make the process more efficient for employers, they are far from perfect. According to a [**Harvard Business Review**](https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/hiddenworkers09032021.pdf) study, 88% of employers reported that highly qualified candidates were filtered out of the process because their resumes didn’t match the exact criteria laid out by the job description. For middle-skilled candidates, that number jumped to 94%.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='So, what can you do to avoid this fate? ## **How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly**\\n\\nHere are some key strategies for making sure your resume makes it through the ATS filter:\\n\\n### **1\\\\. Keep the Formatting Simple**\\n\\nFirst and foremost, your resume’s format should be as clean and simple as possible. Stick to default fonts (Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri) and avoid overly complex formatting. **Avoid columns, graphics, headers, footers, and tables.** These can confuse the ATS, which reads resumes from top to bottom and left to right. If your resume is split into multiple sections, the ATS might misinterpret the information, jumbling up details and missing key points. Simple formatting, bold headers, and standard bullet points will help ensure your resume is readable by the system. Stick to traditional section headings like “Work Experience,” “Skills,” and “Education.” This gives the ATS a clear structure to follow. ### **2\\\\. Tailor Your Resume to the Job Description**\\n\\nThis is one of the most important steps. You need to make sure your resume mirrors the job description as much as possible. **Why?** Because the ATS is specifically looking for resumes that match the job posting’s keywords and phrases. Here’s how to do it effectively:\\n\\n- **Identify Keywords**: Carefully read the job description and highlight key skills, qualifications, and responsibilities. Look for repeated words or phrases, especially in the “Responsibilities” and “Qualifications” sections. These are likely the keywords the ATS will be searching for. - **Match Your Experience**: Once you’ve identified the keywords, make sure they appear in your resume in a natural way. For example, if the job description mentions “project management” and you have that experience, be sure to explicitly list it. Use the exact phrases from the job description to describe your skills and experiences. - **Highlight Relevant Projects**: Projects are a great way to match specific job duties. If the job requires experience managing projects on time and within budget, make sure your resume highlights projects where you’ve demonstrated these skills. ### **3\\\\. Use Standard Headings**\\n\\nATS software often looks for specific headings in your resume to categorize your information. Stick to standard section titles like:\\n\\n- Work Experience\\n- Skills\\n- Education\\n- Certifications Using unconventional headings like “My Achievements” or “Capabilities” could confuse the system, and your experience might not be categorized correctly. ### **4\\\\. Avoid Overly Fancy Language**\\n\\nWhen describing your skills and experience, **keep the language clear and concise**. Avoid overly complex words or creative job titles. If your job title was “Marketing Ninja” at a previous company, change it to something the ATS will recognize, like “Marketing Specialist.” Stick to industry-standard job titles and descriptions so the system understands exactly what you’ve done. ## **Example of an ATS-Friendly Resume**\\n\\nTo make this easier to understand, let’s break down an example. Suppose you’re applying for a Project Manager position and here’s the job description:\\n\\n**Job Description:**\\n\\n- Responsible for planning, directing, and coordinating high-level projects daily. - Ability to think on your feet, communicate well, and lead by example.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='- Completing projects within budget and on time. - Reviewing and coordinating project specifics. - Business development. - Safety compliance adherence. - Schedule monitoring. - Reviewing safety plans and pay applications.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='- Oversee all activities from start to finish. ## **How to Find the Keywords:**\\n\\n- **Core Skills**: Planning, directing, coordinating—these are essential project management tasks, so they should appear in your resume under your experience section. - **Soft Skills**: Think on your feet, communicate well, lead by example—these are important attributes that show adaptability and leadership, and should be highlighted in your resume. - **Specific Tasks**: Budget management, safety compliance, schedule monitoring—these are specific tasks that demonstrate your ability to handle project specifics. If you’ve done similar work, make sure these keywords appear in your resume. - **Full Involvement**: Business development, overseeing all activities—these show your engagement from start to finish, something the employer is likely looking for. ### **ATS-Friendly Resume Example:**\\n\\n**Work Experience**\\n\\n**Project Manager**XYZ Corporation | June 2023 – Present\\n\\n- Planned, directed, and coordinated high-level projects, ensuring on-time and on-budget delivery. - Managed budget and safety compliance for projects, consistently adhering to company guidelines.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='- Led teams in monitoring project schedules and reviewing safety plans.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='- Oversaw all activities from initiation to completion, including business development and pay application reviews. ## **Conclusion**\\n\\nIn today’s job market, creating an ATS-friendly resume is no longer optional—it’s essential. With nearly all Fortune 500 companies using ATS to streamline their hiring process, your resume needs to be designed with the system in mind. By simplifying your format, tailoring your resume to match specific job descriptions, and carefully using keywords, you can increase your chances of getting past the ATS filter and into the hands of a recruiter. Remember, while the ATS can be a challenging barrier, it’s not unbeatable. The more effort you put into crafting a resume that speaks directly to the job you’re applying for, the more likely it is that you’ll stand out—not just to the ATS, but to the people making the hiring decisions.

')], [Document(metadata={}, page_content='# Crafting the Perfect Resume Technical vs. Non-Technical Approaches\\n\\nThere are countless ways to structure a resume, but in the eyes of an HR professional, resumes generally fall into two main categories: **Technical** and **Non-Technical**. Before we dive into the nuances of each, let’s break down the fundamental elements that every resume—regardless of industry or focus—should include. You’ve probably encountered the [frustration of applying for a job](https://opt-imize.com/blog/linkedin-shows-plenty-of-job-openings-but-are-they-truly-available/), only to be redirected to the company’s website where you have to re-enter your details, despite already submitting your resume. Why does this happen? Many employers use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that scan your resume for key information. This extra step ensures your details are parsed correctly, but it also underscores the importance of structuring your resume effectively. The way you organize and present your information will determine how well the ATS—and the hiring manager—understands your qualifications. ### **Language**\\n\\nThe language of your resume matters a lot. It’s not just about listing your tasks; it’s about presenting your accomplishments in a clear, concise, and impactful way that both the ATS and the hiring manager can understand. **Clear, Action-Oriented, and Keyword-Rich Language**:\\n\\n- **Use Action Verbs**: Start each bullet point with strong action verbs to showcase the impact you’ve made. Examples include:\\n  - Managed, Led, Developed, Improved, Analyzed, Implemented.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='- **Incorporate Relevant Keywords**: Use industry-specific terms that match the job description. If you’re applying for a technical role, make sure you’re speaking the language of that industry. Keywords are essential for ATS and also show the hiring manager that you’re aligned with the role. For more on this, check out my blog on **[Creating an ATS-Friendly Resume](https://opt-imize.com/blog/creating-an-ats-friendly-resume/)** or ask Oscar AI to guide you through the process. - **Be Concise**: Keep each bullet point focused on your measurable achievements. Avoid lengthy sentences and focus on the results you delivered. **Example**:  \\nInstead of:  \\n“I was responsible for managing the project team and ensuring the timely delivery of all project milestones.”  \\nUse:  \\n“Led a project team of 10, ensuring 100% on-time delivery of key milestones.”\\n\\n### **Structure**\\n\\nYour resume’s structure is just as important as the content itself. It needs to be logical, clear, and consistent so both the ATS and the hiring manager can easily navigate through your experience and skills. **Standard, Logical, and Consistent Structure**:\\n\\n- **Clear Sections**: Stick to traditional section titles like “Experience,” “Education,” “Skills,” and “Certifications.” Creative labels such as “My Journey” or “Professional Adventures” might sound interesting, but they can confuse ATS systems and hiring managers. **Examples of Section Headings**:\\n  - Experience\\n  - Skills\\n  - Education\\n  - Certifications\\n- **Bullet Points Over Paragraphs**: Bullet points make it easier to quickly scan your achievements. Long paragraphs can be overwhelming and harder to process, both for ATS and humans. - **Chronological or Functional Format**: Stick to reverse-chronological (most recent job first) or functional (skills-focused) formats. These are the most common and easily understood by ATS systems. **Example**:  \\n**Experience**_Company Name_, Project Manager _(Jan 2020 – Present)_\\n\\n- Managed cross-functional teams to deliver 15+ projects, increasing efficiency by 20%. - Developed project timelines, reducing delivery delays by 30%. ### **Font Types**\\n\\nYou might not think about it, but the font you use can make or break your resume’s readability—both for humans and ATS systems. **Simple, Professional, and Readable Fonts**:\\n\\n- **Sans Serif Fonts**: These fonts are modern, clean, and highly readable by ATS systems. Examples include:\\n  - _Arial_: Classic and professional. - _Calibri_: A modern and easy-to-read font. - _Helvetica_: Known for its clarity and simplicity. - **Serif Fonts**: While less common, serif fonts can still be used if they are clean and simple. - _Times New Roman_: A traditional, professional choice. - _Georgia_: Slightly more modern, but equally readable. - **Font Size**: For body text, use size 9-12, and for section headings, use a slightly larger size (10-14) to make them stand out. ## **Technical Resume: Tailoring Your Skills for STEM and Beyond**\\n\\nA **technical resume** is typically used for roles in STEM fields—like data analytics, software development, engineering, IT, and more. These resumes are highly specific and emphasize technical skills, certifications, and projects that directly relate to the job you’re applying for. While experience still matters, **the projects you’ve completed and the certifications you hold** often carry more weight with hiring managers in technical fields. ### **Key Elements of a Technical Resume:**\\n\\n1. **Technical Skills Section**: This is non-negotiable. You need to clearly list out the programming languages, software tools, and other technical proficiencies you have. Hiring managers want to quickly scan this section to see if you have the foundational knowledge they require. 2. **Certifications**: Whether it’s a certification in Python, AWS, or project management, certifications demonstrate both your expertise and commitment to continuous learning. They also prove that you meet industry standards for certain technical skills.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='3. **Projects**: These are the bread and butter of a technical resume. Projects show what you can do with the skills you’ve acquired. Not only do they validate your experience, but they also provide the hiring manager with tangible examples of how you apply your knowledge to solve problems. #### **Example of a Technical Resume:**\\n\\nLet’s take a look at how you would frame your experience in a **software development** role. **Experience**_XYZ Corporation\\\\_\\\\_Software Developer (June 2020 – Present)_\\n\\n- Developed a cloud-based microservices architecture, increasing system scalability by 30%. - Led a team of 5 developers in the migration of legacy systems to modern cloud infrastructure (AWS), reducing operational costs by 15%. - Integrated CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment, reducing release cycles from two weeks to three days. **Projects**\\n\\n1. **Real-Time Data Processing App**\\n    - Developed a real-time data processing application using **Python** and **Apache Kafka**, enabling real-time analytics on streaming data for a healthcare provider. - Implemented data transformation and validation pipelines, reducing processing time by 40%. - **Key Skills**: Python, Apache Kafka, Data Analytics, Cloud Infrastructure. 2. **E-Commerce Recommendation Engine**\\n    - Built a recommendation engine using **machine learning algorithms** to enhance product suggestions on an e-commerce platform, increasing customer engagement by 20%. - Used **Python** and **TensorFlow** to build, train, and optimize the recommendation model. - **Key Skills**: Machine Learning, Python, TensorFlow, Data Analytics.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='3. **AWS Cloud Migration**\\n    - Successfully migrated an enterprise system from on-premise servers to **AWS Cloud**, resulting in a 25% reduction in infrastructure costs and improved system reliability. - Utilized **EC2**, **S3**, and **Lambda** services for optimal performance and scalability.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='- **Key Skills**: AWS, Cloud Architecture, EC2, S3, Lambda. ### **Why Projects Matter**\\n\\nIn technical fields, **projects** often carry more significance than just job titles. Hiring managers are looking for concrete evidence of how you can apply your technical skills in real-world situations. For example, if a job posting mentions cloud migration or machine learning expertise, and you have a project that directly aligns with those tasks, you’re much more likely to stand out. Certifications also play a critical role. They serve as proof that you’re up-to-date with the latest industry tools and technologies. Having a **Google Data Analytics certification** or **AWS Solutions Architect** certification shows the employer that not only do you have the skills they need, but you’ve also gone the extra mile to validate those skills through recognized institutions. When crafting a technical resume, always think about how your projects and certifications relate directly to the role you’re applying for. The more relevant and specific they are, the better your chances of impressing the hiring manager. Remember, they’re not just looking at your job titles—they want to know if you’ve successfully implemented solutions similar to what their company needs. If you can show them that you’ve done exactly what they’re looking for in a previous project, they may go to great lengths to hire you. ## **Non-Technical Resume: Highlighting Experience Over Projects**\\n\\nA **non-technical resume** is typically used for roles outside the STEM fields—think marketing, sales, human resources, business development, and education. These resumes focus less on technical projects and more on your experience, soft skills, and professional growth. That said, even some STEM-related roles, especially those in management or strategy, can fit into this category, where the emphasis is placed more on your overall experience than on individual projects or certifications. In a non-technical resume, **experience** becomes the star of the show. Hiring managers are less concerned with specific technical proficiencies and more interested in your ability to adapt, lead, communicate, and drive results in a variety of situations. ### **Key Elements of a Non-Technical Resume:**\\n\\n1. **Experience Section**: This is where you show how your past roles have prepared you for the job at hand. The focus should be on **achievements**—what you’ve accomplished, rather than just listing duties. Employers want to see that you’ve made an impact in your previous roles, whether that’s by increasing sales, improving team productivity, or launching successful campaigns. 2. **Skills Section**: While not as technical as a STEM role, you still need to highlight key skills that apply to your industry. These might include leadership, project management, communication, budgeting, or specific software knowledge like CRM tools for sales or Adobe Creative Suite for marketing. 3. **Education and Certifications**: While certifications aren’t as essential as they are in technical fields, if you have any that are relevant—such as leadership courses, communication training, or specialized industry certifications—be sure to include them. They show you’re committed to personal and professional growth. #### **Example of a Non-Technical Resume:**\\n\\nLet’s look at an example for a **Marketing Manager** role. **Experience**_ABC Marketing Agency\\\\_\\\\_Marketing Manager (April 2018 – Present)_\\n\\n- Spearheaded a digital marketing campaign for a national retail brand, increasing online sales by 40% within six months.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='- Managed a team of 8 marketing professionals, overseeing content creation, social media strategy, and email marketing. - Developed and implemented SEO strategies, improving the company’s organic search traffic by 25%. - Collaborated with the sales department to align marketing strategies with business goals, resulting in a 15% increase in lead generation. **XYZ Corporation**_Assistant Marketing Manager (June 2015 – April 2018)_\\n\\n- Assisted in the execution of multi-channel marketing campaigns, contributing to a 30% increase in brand visibility. - Managed vendor relationships and oversaw budget allocation for marketing activities. - Conducted market research and competitor analysis to identify growth opportunities.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='- Supported the rebranding of the company, which led to a 20% increase in customer engagement. **Skills**\\n\\n- Team Leadership\\n- Strategic Marketing\\n- SEO and SEM\\n- Content Strategy\\n- Budget Management\\n- CRM Tools (Salesforce, HubSpot)\\n\\n### **Why Experience Matters More in Non-Technical Resumes**\\n\\nIn non-technical fields, **experience** often speaks louder than any individual project. Employers want to know how you’ve handled diverse responsibilities, led teams, or driven business results in your previous roles. For example, in a marketing role, the fact that you increased sales by 40% through a strategic campaign is more impactful than listing a specific technical tool you used to do so. It’s about showing **impact**, **leadership**, and **the ability to achieve results**. That’s not to say projects don’t matter at all in non-technical resumes—they just don’t take center stage. The key is to show how your experience has prepared you for the role you’re applying for. Focus on what you’ve accomplished, not just what you were responsible for. Employers want to know how you’ve added value in your previous roles and how those experiences have prepared you for the position you’re applying for. Keep the language clear and concise, and always highlight the impact you’ve made. By tailoring your resume to emphasize your experience and achievements, you’ll stand out as a candidate who can deliver results and lead in a non-technical role. ')], [Document(metadata={}, page_content='# LinkedIn Shows Plenty of Job Openings, But Are They Truly Available? Working in HR for the past six years, I’ve seen firsthand how LinkedIn has become a go-to platform for job seekers and employers alike. It’s a powerful tool for networking, sharing, and discovering job opportunities—arguably one of the top places to find jobs today. However, while LinkedIn is great for visibility and initial contact, it’s not always the best platform for completing the entire application process. Most employers rely on Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), making it challenging to keep the full recruitment workflow on LinkedIn. This means that even though a job may be posted on LinkedIn, the actual application is often diverted to an external system. Adding to this complexity, many companies have multiple job openings managed by a handful of recruiters or hiring managers, which can lead to inconsistencies and delays. While some companies have managed to integrate LinkedIn job postings with their Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), in most cases, HR teams have to manually repost job listings on LinkedIn, creating a tedious and often repetitive process for hiring managers. **Why Are Job Seekers Struggling to Find Jobs?**\\n\\nDespite the apparent abundance of job openings, job seekers continue to face challenges in securing employment. According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm), there were 9.6 million job openings in September 2023. Yet, this figure raised eyebrows as hiring numbers seemed unusually low, leaving many to wonder: If there are millions of open jobs, why aren’t more people getting hired? In fact, less than 2% of those 9.6 million openings were filled by October. To dig deeper into this issue, a survey conducted by [Clarify Capital in October 2023](https://clarifycapital.com/job-seekers-beware-of-ghost-jobs-survey) found that 50% of hiring managers admitted to creating job postings not to fill immediate vacancies, but rather to build a “warm talent pool.” This means that many job listings are essentially placeholders, intended to attract potential candidates for future needs rather than current ones. This practice leaves job seekers in a difficult position—wasting time and effort on applications that aren’t for genuinely open roles.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='But this isn’t the only issue at play. The challenges job seekers face are multifaceted, and there are a few more layers to this problem that are worth exploring to truly understand what’s going on behind the scenes on job boards like LinkedIn. Let’s dive deeper into these nuances.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='**HR Strategy with Job Descriptions**\\n\\nA well-crafted job description is as crucial to the hiring process as finding the right candidate. According to [HRSG’s State of Job Descriptions 2020 Survey](https://resources.hrsg.ca/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-write-a-job-description#:~:text=More%20than%2050%25%20of%20our,planning%20and%20other%20daily%20responsibilities.), about 65% of HR professionals reported spending two hours or more drafting a single job description from scratch. This initial draft is just the beginning—it often goes through several rounds of approvals from hiring managers and requires research on industry trends and comparable roles to ensure competitiveness and clarity.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='In a project I worked on with a previous employer in 2023, the company adopted a strategy to keep job postings open for roles that required frequent hiring. Instead of creating a new job post every time a position needed filling, the HRIS system or HR team would simply repost the existing one. While efficient, this tactic also led to situations where job postings remained active even when there were no immediate vacancies, creating confusion for job seekers. However, this approach allowed the company to build a “resume bank” over several years, which proved valuable for refining job descriptions. By analyzing the types of candidates applying, the company could adjust job descriptions to attract more suitable talent. For example, resumes submitted five years ago might rarely list “Excel” as a skill, but today, nearly every applicant highlights experience with Excel or even advanced Excel functions. This evolving data helped HR teams update job descriptions to align better with the changing skill set landscape, thereby attracting higher-quality candidates. **An Unusual Labor Economy**\\n\\nIn today’s [unpredictable labor market](https://www.fastcompany.com/91019872/employers-are-intentionally-leaving-job-openings-unfilled-heres-why), many U.S. employers are not rushing to fill positions.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='This strategy can be seen as a calculated move in response to economic uncertainty. Keeping positions vacant or “slow-rolling” the hiring process allows companies to reduce expenses and stay ahead of budget goals. This maneuver helps organizations maintain the appearance of active hiring and growth while discreetly achieving cost savings. Such tactics enable the C-suite to meet quarterly financial targets without the negative optics of removing job postings altogether from their career sites. **HR Staff Count vs. Number of Openings**\\n\\nThe imbalance between the number of HR staff and job openings is another reason behind misleading job postings. Most companies have far more job openings than HR professionals available to manage them. A 2022 survey by [HR company Workvivo](https://www.workvivo.com/blog/hr-burnout-what-why-solutions/) found that 98% of recruiting and HR professionals are experiencing burnout, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work. The recruitment cycle is often relentless, and during peak times, the number of open positions can far exceed what the HR team can reasonably handle. When job openings surge, HR departments often struggle to keep up. As a result, even as some positions are being filled, they are not always promptly removed from job boards. These listings continue to accept applications, misleading job seekers into thinking that positions are still available. Even with the introduction of AI-driven solutions to streamline this process, the closure of job postings often remains a manual and cumbersome task. This gap between job listing management and actual hiring needs contributes to the perception that there are plenty of job openings, but few actual hires, creating frustration for job seekers navigating the market. ### **The Reality Behind Job Openings for International Students**\\n\\nFor international students, navigating the U.S. job market comes with unique challenges beyond the typical difficulties faced by all job seekers. The combination of strategic job postings, a cautious labor market approach, and overwhelmed HR teams creates a particularly misleading and often frustrating landscape. While LinkedIn and other job boards might display an abundance of job openings, the reality for international students is even more complicated. Many companies leave roles open not because they are actively hiring, but to build a pool of potential candidates for future needs. For international students, who face additional constraints such as visa sponsorship requirements and tight OPT or CPT timelines, these practices can lead to wasted time and effort. They may find themselves applying for jobs that are not immediately available or even real, which only adds to the stress as their visa deadlines approach. Additionally, a cautious labor market means companies might be slow to hire, trying to cut costs by leaving positions vacant for longer periods. This can create the illusion of growth and opportunity on job boards, but for international students who must secure employment within a limited time frame to maintain their visa status, these misleading postings can be particularly disheartening. Overwhelmed HR teams often delay updating job statuses, resulting in students chasing opportunities that have already closed. ### **How to Navigate and Improve Your Job Search Strategy**\\n\\nGiven these challenges, international students need to adopt a more strategic approach to their job search. The probability of landing an actual open position increases significantly by applying to more jobs, reaching out to referrals, and actively networking. Simply relying on job boards alone can often lead to dead ends, as many of these postings are not current or are placeholders for future hiring. To increase the chances of success, students should prioritize networking—both online and offline. Connecting with alumni, attending career fairs, participating in industry-specific events, and reaching out to professionals for informational interviews can provide valuable insights and potential referrals. Personal connections can often bypass the crowded applicant pool that online job boards create, providing a more direct path to a real opportunity. Another strategy is to use referrals strategically. Employees are often incentivized to refer candidates for open positions, and a referral can move your application to the top of the pile, even bypassing the ATS. Moreover, actively engaging with companies through LinkedIn by commenting on their posts, attending their webinars, and following up with recruiters can also set you apart from the crowd. Ultimately, navigating the job market as an international student requires persistence and a multi-pronged approach. Understanding that not every job posting represents a real, immediate opportunity is the first step. ')]]\n",

The challenges job seekers face are multifaceted, and there are a few more layers to this problem that are worth exploring to truly understand what’s going on behind the scenes on job boards like LinkedIn. Let’s dive deeper into these nuances.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='**HR Strategy with Job Descriptions**\\n\\nA well-crafted job description is as crucial to the hiring process as finding the right candidate. According to [HRSG’s State of Job Descriptions 2020 Survey](https://resources.hrsg.ca/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-write-a-job-description#:~:text=More%20than%2050%25%20of%20our,planning%20and%20other%20daily%20responsibilities.), about 65% of HR professionals reported spending two hours or more drafting a single job description from scratch. This initial draft is just the beginning—it often goes through several rounds of approvals from hiring managers and requires research on industry trends and comparable roles to ensure competitiveness and clarity.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='In a project I worked on with a previous employer in 2023, the company adopted a strategy to keep job postings open for roles that required frequent hiring. Instead of creating a new job post every time a position needed filling, the HRIS system or HR team would simply repost the existing one. While efficient, this tactic also led to situations where job postings remained active even when there were no immediate vacancies, creating confusion for job seekers. However, this approach allowed the company to build a “resume bank” over several years, which proved valuable for refining job descriptions. By analyzing the types of candidates applying, the company could adjust job descriptions to attract more suitable talent. For example, resumes submitted five years ago might rarely list “Excel” as a skill, but today, nearly every applicant highlights experience with Excel or even advanced Excel functions. This evolving data helped HR teams update job descriptions to align better with the changing skill set landscape, thereby attracting higher-quality candidates. **An Unusual Labor Economy**\\n\\nIn today’s [unpredictable labor market](https://www.fastcompany.com/91019872/employers-are-intentionally-leaving-job-openings-unfilled-heres-why), many U.S. employers are not rushing to fill positions.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='This strategy can be seen as a calculated move in response to economic uncertainty. Keeping positions vacant or “slow-rolling” the hiring process allows companies to reduce expenses and stay ahead of budget goals. This maneuver helps organizations maintain the appearance of active hiring and growth while discreetly achieving cost savings. Such tactics enable the C-suite to meet quarterly financial targets without the negative optics of removing job postings altogether from their career sites. **HR Staff Count vs. Number of Openings**\\n\\nThe imbalance between the number of HR staff and job openings is another reason behind misleading job postings. Most companies have far more job openings than HR professionals available to manage them. A 2022 survey by [HR company Workvivo](https://www.workvivo.com/blog/hr-burnout-what-why-solutions/) found that 98% of recruiting and HR professionals are experiencing burnout, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work. The recruitment cycle is often relentless, and during peak times, the number of open positions can far exceed what the HR team can reasonably handle. When job openings surge, HR departments often struggle to keep up. As a result, even as some positions are being filled, they are not always promptly removed from job boards. These listings continue to accept applications, misleading job seekers into thinking that positions are still available. Even with the introduction of AI-driven solutions to streamline this process, the closure of job postings often remains a manual and cumbersome task. This gap between job listing management and actual hiring needs contributes to the perception that there are plenty of job openings, but few actual hires, creating frustration for job seekers navigating the market. ### **The Reality Behind Job Openings for International Students**\\n\\nFor international students, navigating the U.S. job market comes with unique challenges beyond the typical difficulties faced by all job seekers. The combination of strategic job postings, a cautious labor market approach, and overwhelmed HR teams creates a particularly misleading and often frustrating landscape. While LinkedIn and other job boards might display an abundance of job openings, the reality for international students is even more complicated. Many companies leave roles open not because they are actively hiring, but to build a pool of potential candidates for future needs. For international students, who face additional constraints such as visa sponsorship requirements and tight OPT or CPT timelines, these practices can lead to wasted time and effort. They may find themselves applying for jobs that are not immediately available or even real, which only adds to the stress as their visa deadlines approach. Additionally, a cautious labor market means companies might be slow to hire, trying to cut costs by leaving positions vacant for longer periods. This can create the illusion of growth and opportunity on job boards, but for international students who must secure employment within a limited time frame to maintain their visa status, these misleading postings can be particularly disheartening. Overwhelmed HR teams often delay updating job statuses, resulting in students chasing opportunities that have already closed. ### **How to Navigate and Improve Your Job Search Strategy**\\n\\nGiven these challenges, international students need to adopt a more strategic approach to their job search. The probability of landing an actual open position increases significantly by applying to more jobs, reaching out to referrals, and actively networking. Simply relying on job boards alone can often lead to dead ends, as many of these postings are not current or are placeholders for future hiring. To increase the chances of success, students should prioritize networking—both online and offline. Connecting with alumni, attending career fairs, participating in industry-specific events, and reaching out to professionals for informational interviews can provide valuable insights and potential referrals. Personal connections can often bypass the crowded applicant pool that online job boards create, providing a more direct path to a real opportunity. Another strategy is to use referrals strategically. Employees are often incentivized to refer candidates for open positions, and a referral can move your application to the top of the pile, even bypassing the ATS. Moreover, actively engaging with companies through LinkedIn by commenting on their posts, attending their webinars, and following up with recruiters can also set you apart from the crowd. Ultimately, navigating the job market as an international student requires persistence and a multi-pronged approach. Understanding that not every job posting represents a real, immediate opportunity is the first step. ')]\n",

It’s a powerful tool for networking, sharing, and discovering job opportunities—arguably one of the top places to find jobs today. However, while LinkedIn is great for visibility and initial contact, it’s not always the best platform for completing the entire application process. Most employers rely on Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), making it challenging to keep the full recruitment workflow on LinkedIn. This means that even though a job may be posted on LinkedIn, the actual application is often diverted to an external system. Adding to this complexity, many companies have multiple job openings managed by a handful of recruiters or hiring managers, which can lead to inconsistencies and delays. While some companies have managed to integrate LinkedIn job postings with their Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), in most cases, HR teams have to manually repost job listings on LinkedIn, creating a tedious and often repetitive process for hiring managers. **Why Are Job Seekers Struggling to Find Jobs?**\\n\\nDespite the apparent abundance of job openings, job seekers continue to face challenges in securing employment. According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm), there were 9.6 million job openings in September 2023. Yet, this figure raised eyebrows as hiring numbers seemed unusually low, leaving many to wonder: If there are millions of open jobs, why aren’t more people getting hired? In fact, less than 2% of those 9.6 million openings were filled by October. To dig deeper into this issue, a survey conducted by [Clarify Capital in October 2023](https://clarifycapital.com/job-seekers-beware-of-ghost-jobs-survey) found that 50% of hiring managers admitted to creating job postings not to fill immediate vacancies, but rather to build a “warm talent pool.” This means that many job listings are essentially placeholders, intended to attract potential candidates for future needs rather than current ones. This practice leaves job seekers in a difficult position—wasting time and effort on applications that aren’t for genuinely open roles.'), Document(id='061bfa0a-bd47-44f2-9a27-6970689e7bb0', metadata={}, page_content='This strategy can be seen as a calculated move in response to economic uncertainty. Keeping positions vacant or “slow-rolling” the hiring process allows companies to reduce expenses and stay ahead of budget goals. This maneuver helps organizations maintain the appearance of active hiring and growth while discreetly achieving cost savings. Such tactics enable the C-suite to meet quarterly financial targets without the negative optics of removing job postings altogether from their career sites. **HR Staff Count vs. Number of Openings**\\n\\nThe imbalance between the number of HR staff and job openings is another reason behind misleading job postings. Most companies have far more job openings than HR professionals available to manage them. A 2022 survey by [HR company Workvivo](https://www.workvivo.com/blog/hr-burnout-what-why-solutions/) found that 98% of recruiting and HR professionals are experiencing burnout, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work. The recruitment cycle is often relentless, and during peak times, the number of open positions can far exceed what the HR team can reasonably handle. When job openings surge, HR departments often struggle to keep up. As a result, even as some positions are being filled, they are not always promptly removed from job boards. These listings continue to accept applications, misleading job seekers into thinking that positions are still available. Even with the introduction of AI-driven solutions to streamline this process, the closure of job postings often remains a manual and cumbersome task. This gap between job listing management and actual hiring needs contributes to the perception that there are plenty of job openings, but few actual hires, creating frustration for job seekers navigating the market. ### **The Reality Behind Job Openings for International Students**\\n\\nFor international students, navigating the U.S. job market comes with unique challenges beyond the typical difficulties faced by all job seekers. The combination of strategic job postings, a cautious labor market approach, and overwhelmed HR teams creates a particularly misleading and often frustrating landscape. While LinkedIn and other job boards might display an abundance of job openings, the reality for international students is even more complicated. Many companies leave roles open not because they are actively hiring, but to build a pool of potential candidates for future needs. For international students, who face additional constraints such as visa sponsorship requirements and tight OPT or CPT timelines, these practices can lead to wasted time and effort. They may find themselves applying for jobs that are not immediately available or even real, which only adds to the stress as their visa deadlines approach. Additionally, a cautious labor market means companies might be slow to hire, trying to cut costs by leaving positions vacant for longer periods. This can create the illusion of growth and opportunity on job boards, but for international students who must secure employment within a limited time frame to maintain their visa status, these misleading postings can be particularly disheartening. Overwhelmed HR teams often delay updating job statuses, resulting in students chasing opportunities that have already closed. ### **How to Navigate and Improve Your Job Search Strategy**\\n\\nGiven these challenges, international students need to adopt a more strategic approach to their job search. The probability of landing an actual open position increases significantly by applying to more jobs, reaching out to referrals, and actively networking. Simply relying on job boards alone can often lead to dead ends, as many of these postings are not current or are placeholders for future hiring. To increase the chances of success, students should prioritize networking—both online and offline. Connecting with alumni, attending career fairs, participating in industry-specific events, and reaching out to professionals for informational interviews can provide valuable insights and potential referrals. Personal connections can often bypass the crowded applicant pool that online job boards create, providing a more direct path to a real opportunity. Another strategy is to use referrals strategically. Employees are often incentivized to refer candidates for open positions, and a referral can move your application to the top of the pile, even bypassing the ATS. Moreover, actively engaging with companies through LinkedIn by commenting on their posts, attending their webinars, and following up with recruiters can also set you apart from the crowd. Ultimately, navigating the job market as an international student requires persistence and a multi-pronged approach. Understanding that not every job posting represents a real, immediate opportunity is the first step.
