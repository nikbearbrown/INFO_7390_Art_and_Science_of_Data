# AI Policy for Coursework

## Use of AI in Assignments

The use of AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) is permitted in this course, with the following requirements:

1. **All AI usage must be properly cited**
   * Include the name of the AI tool used
   * Specify which portions of your work were AI-assisted
   * Describe how the AI was used (e.g., generating code, editing text, brainstorming ideas)

2. **Demonstration of Understanding**
   * Students must be able to explain any AI-generated content in their submissions
   * Teaching Assistants or the Professor may ask students to walk through and explain any part of their work
   * Inability to demonstrate understanding of submitted work may result in grade penalties

3. **Academic Integrity**
   * Students are responsible for all submitted work, regardless of how it was generated
   * AI should be used as a tool to enhance learning, not to bypass it
   * Using AI without citation constitutes academic dishonesty

## Quality Expectations and Grading

Due to the widespread availability of AI tools, a relative grading component (20% of total points) will be applied to all assignments worth 100 points or more. This component evaluates your work compared to peers, with emphasis on:

* Originality and creativity beyond AI-generated content
* Depth of understanding demonstrated
* Customization and personalization of solutions
* Real-world applicability

### Quality Score Breakdown (20 points)

* **Bottom 25% (5 points)**
   * Meets basic requirements but lacks depth or real-world relevance
   * Basic implementation with minimal customization
   * Limited error handling and agent interaction
   * Superficial documentation and demonstration

* **26-50th percentile (10 points)**
   * Solid implementation with thoughtful agent design
   * Functional tools with appropriate integration
   * Basic error handling and memory implementation
   * Clear documentation and demonstration

* **51-75th percentile (15 points)**
   * Strong technical implementation with clear real-world applications
   * Sophisticated agent interactions and tool integration
   * Comprehensive error handling and memory management
   * Professional documentation and compelling demonstration
   * Evidence of testing and performance optimization

* **Top 25% (20 points)**
   * Exceptional project demonstrating innovation and technical excellence
   * Novel application with demonstrable value
   * Advanced agent orchestration with sophisticated decision-making
   * Unique custom tool that significantly enhances capabilities
   * Production-ready implementation with attention to scalability
   * Outstanding documentation and presentation

## Best Practices for AI Use

1. **Use AI as a learning tool**
   * Ask for explanations of concepts you don't understand
   * Request alternative approaches to problems
   * Use AI to review your work and suggest improvements

2. **Maintain your voice and perspective**
   * Edit and refine AI-generated content to reflect your understanding
   * Add your own insights and observations
   * Ensure the final work represents your learning and knowledge

3. **Document your process**
   * Keep a record of your prompts and the AI's responses
   * Note any modifications you made to AI-generated content
   * Be prepared to discuss your collaboration with AI during evaluation

By following this policy, you can ethically leverage AI tools while ensuring they enhance rather than replace your learning experience in this course.
