# Course Description

**Garbage-In Garbage Out (GIGO)** may be the most widely used maxim in machine learning, but how does one assess the quality of each step in an analysis pipeline? This course teaches students how to understand their data, models, and pipelines using visualization.

## Part I - Understanding Data

The first part of the course covers understanding the statistical properties of a data set visually, how to fix issues with their data, and how to graphically demonstrate how the data was improved. The choice of the right chart for a particular question is covered. The principles of visual design, including typography, contrast, balance, emphasis, movement, white space, proportion, hierarchy, repetition, rhythm, pattern, unity, and variety are covered.

### 1A - Data Analysis and Improvement

In the initial segment of the course, students will be introduced to visual understanding of a dataset's statistical properties. This includes identifying potential problems within the data and implementing corrective measures. We'll also delve into effective graphical methods to showcase the enhancement and transformation of data. An essential part of this section is selecting the most suitable chart type to address specific questions or insights about the dataset.

### 1B - Principles of Visual Design in Data Presentation

In this segment, we put emphasis on the art and science of visual design as it pertains to data presentation. Students will explore various fundamental principles, including typography, contrast, and balance. Additionally, we'll discuss advanced design concepts such as emphasis, movement, the strategic use of white space, proportion, hierarchy, and more. We'll also delve into the significance of repetition, rhythm, pattern, unity, and variety, ensuring that the data is not only accurate but also aesthetically compelling and easily comprehensible.

## Part II - Generative AI for Data

### 2A - Understanding Generative AI

Dive deep into the world of generative AI and its impressive capability to produce content. This section introduces its practical uses and constraints. We will differentiate between traditional machine learning models, generative AI, and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Additionally, we'll uncover the primary elements fueling the progress of generative AI.

### 2B - Building Generative AI Systems

This segment details the crucial procedures involved in crafting generative AI systems. Topics covered include research, design, data gathering, model training, and assessment. Emphasis is placed on the importance of varied datasets and cutting-edge training strategies. We will also explore the different evaluation techniques, highlighting their advantages and drawbacks.

### 2C - Employing Generative AI for Synthetic Data Creation

In this section, we venture into the practical application of generative AI in fabricating synthetic data. Whether it's text, visuals, videos, or soundscapes, generative AI offers innovative solutions for generating authentic-seeming content. We'll break down the mechanics behind these processes, demonstrating how cutting-edge models can craft content that's nearly indistinguishable from real-world data, and discuss the potential advantages and challenges of using synthetic data across various sectors.

### 2D - Leveraging Generative AI for Data Verification

In this segment, we explore how generative AI can play a pivotal role in data verification. By harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) and cross-referencing information across them, we can enhance the accuracy and reliability of our data. We'll discuss the methodologies behind this innovative approach, detailing how multiple LLMs can be employed in tandem to validate the authenticity of a piece of information. Additionally, we'll touch upon the benefits of this process, emphasizing the increased trustworthiness of data and the reduction in misinformation.

## Part III - Causal Inference

The third part of the course covers visualizing causal relationships in data. The emphasis is on understanding visual techniques for separating causal relationships for correlation.

### 3A - Visual Techniques in Causal Data

In this segment of the course, the primary focus will be on the visualization of causal relationships within datasets. We aim to provide a robust understanding of visual methods that can be employed to distinguish genuine causal connections from mere correlations. This involves diving deep into concepts such as confounding, causal graphs, and the intricate relationship between Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and probability distributions. The segment will also highlight the significance of paths and associations, along with the idea of conditional independence through d-separation.

### 3B - Advanced Causal Analysis Techniques

Venturing further into the realm of causality, this segment dives into the practical aspects and methodologies used in observational studies. Techniques and concepts such as optimal matching, sensitivity analysis, and Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) will be detailed. The course will subsequently move into the nuances of marginal structural models, providing insights on IPTW estimation and the meticulous process of causal effect identification and estimation. This part of the course aims to equip students with the advanced tools and knowledge necessary for in-depth causal analyses in complex scenarios.
