### Course Prerequisites
INFO 6105 - There will be an early assessment of what was learned in INFO 6105. Knowledge of basic statistical learning is essential to the course.

### Course Description
Garbage-In Garbage Out (GIGO) may be the most widely used maxim in machine learning, but how does one assess the quality of each step in an analysis pipeline? This course teaches students how to understand their data, models and pipelines using visualization and computational skepticism, empowering them to create robust, trustworthy AI systems.

The first part of the course introduces AI Fluency and Computational Skepticism principles with the Botspeak framework. Students will learn critical thinking approaches for AI validation and develop systematic doubt in AI workflows.

The second part covers understanding the statistical properties of a data set visually, how to fix issues with their data, and how to graphically demonstrate how the data was improved. The choice of the right chart for a particular question is covered. The principles of visual design, including typography, contrast, balance, emphasis, movement, white space, proportion, hierarchy, repetition, rhythm, pattern, unity, and variety are covered.

The third part explores generative AI for data, focusing on creating synthetic data across various modalities (text, numeric, image, audio, video). Students will learn to evaluate synthetic data quality and apply computational skepticism to verify AI-generated information.

The fourth part covers visualizing causal relationships in data. The emphasis is on understanding visual techniques for separating causal relationships from correlation using advanced methods like DAGs and counterfactual frameworks.

Throughout the course, students will build agentic AI tools that implement the principles of computational skepticism and AI fluency to validate data, models, and analytical pipelines.
