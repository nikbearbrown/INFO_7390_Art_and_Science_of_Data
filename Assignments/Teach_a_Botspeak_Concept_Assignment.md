# "Teach a Botspeak Concept" Assignment (100 Points)

## Overview
In this assignment, you will teach one concept from the Botspeak framework by creating educational content that demonstrates your understanding of human-AI collaboration principles. Choose one concept from the Botspeak Loop (Define, Delegate, Direct, Diagnose, Decide, Document) or one of the Nine Pillars of AI Fluency.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate comprehensive understanding of a Botspeak concept
- Create engaging educational materials in multiple formats
- Apply the concept to real-world AI collaboration scenarios
- Develop practical tools to help others implement the concept

## Requirements (80 Points)

### Part 1: Concept Exploration (20 Points)
- **Definition and Foundations (5 points)**
  - Clearly define your chosen Botspeak concept
  - Connect it to relevant philosophical foundations (Descartes, Hume, Popper, etc.)
  - Explain how it fits within the larger Botspeak framework
  
- **Purpose and Significance (5 points)**
  - Explain why this concept is critical for effective human-AI collaboration
  - Discuss its impact on AI system reliability, safety, and usefulness
  
- **Real-World Applications (10 points)**
  - Provide 2-3 detailed examples showing the concept in action
  - Include one example of what happens when this concept is neglected
  - Analyze outcomes and lessons learned from each example

### Part 2: Educational Demonstration (20 Points)
- **Scenario Creation (8 points)**
  - Develop a realistic scenario where your concept applies
  - Include necessary context: stakeholders, goals, constraints, and risks
  
- **Implementation Demonstration (12 points)**
  - Create a step-by-step walkthrough showing how to apply the concept
  - Include templates, checklists, or frameworks that others can reuse
  - Demonstrate both successful and unsuccessful approaches

### Part 3: Multi-Format Presentation (25 Points)
Create educational content in TWO different formats:

- **Format 1 (12 points)**
  Choose one: video tutorial, interactive simulation, infographic, case study, etc.
  
- **Format 2 (13 points)**
  Choose a different format than Format 1

Both formats must:
- Clearly explain the concept's definition, importance, and application
- Include visual elements that enhance understanding
- Engage the audience through storytelling or interactive elements
- Provide practical takeaways for implementing the concept

### Part 4: Assessment Tools (15 Points)
- **Knowledge Check (7 points)**
  - Create 3-5 quiz questions testing understanding of your concept
  - Include a mix of multiple-choice, scenario-based, and application questions
  
- **Practical Exercise (8 points)**
  - Design an activity where others apply your concept to a new scenario
  - Include clear instructions, success criteria, and reflection questions

## Quality Score (20 Points)
Your assignment will be evaluated against others in the class and assigned a quality score based on its percentile ranking:
* **Top 25%**: 16-20 points
   * Exceptional innovation, polish, and educational effectiveness
   * Outstanding use of uploaded data and platform capabilities
   * Professional-quality interface and interactions
* **Upper-Middle 25%**: 11-15 points
   * Strong implementation with notable features
   * Effective data integration and educational approach
   * Well-designed user experience
* **Lower-Middle 25%**: 6-10 points
   * Satisfactory implementation meeting basic requirements
   * Adequate use of uploaded materials
   * Functional but with room for improvement
* **Bottom 25%**: 0-5 points
   * Minimal implementation lacking key features
   * Limited use of uploaded data
   * Significant usability or educational effectiveness issues

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit all materials in a single, organized package
- Include a brief (1-page) reflection on your teaching approach and rationale
- Ensure all interactive elements are fully functional and accessible
- Cite all sources appropriately using APA format

## Example Assignment: Teaching "Diagnose" in the Botspeak Loop
### Part 1: Concept Exploration
- Define "Diagnose" as the critical evaluation phase in the Botspeak Loop
- Connect to Hume's induction skepticism and Popper's falsifiability
- Explain its role in preventing unchecked AI outputs from causing harm

### Part 2: Educational Demonstration
- Scenario: AI-generated medical triage recommendations
- Implementation: Show acceptance tests, calibration checks, and bias detection techniques

### Part 3: Multi-Format Presentation
- Format 1: Interactive flowchart showing the diagnosis decision tree
- Format 2: Video role-play demonstrating a team conducting diagnosis

### Part 4: Assessment Tools
- Quiz: "What are the key signals of distribution shift in an AI system?"
- Exercise: "Evaluate this AI output against acceptance criteria and identify potential issues"
