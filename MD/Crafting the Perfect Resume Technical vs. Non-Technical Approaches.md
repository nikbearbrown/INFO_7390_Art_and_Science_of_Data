# Crafting the Perfect Resume Technical vs. Non-Technical Approaches

There are countless ways to structure a resume, but in the eyes of an HR professional, resumes generally fall into two main categories: **Technical** and **Non-Technical**. Before we dive into the nuances of each, let’s break down the fundamental elements that every resume—regardless of industry or focus—should include.

You’ve probably encountered the [frustration of applying for a job](https://opt-imize.com/blog/linkedin-shows-plenty-of-job-openings-but-are-they-truly-available/), only to be redirected to the company’s website where you have to re-enter your details, despite already submitting your resume. Why does this happen? Many employers use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that scan your resume for key information. This extra step ensures your details are parsed correctly, but it also underscores the importance of structuring your resume effectively. The way you organize and present your information will determine how well the ATS—and the hiring manager—understands your qualifications.

### **Language**

The language of your resume matters a lot. It’s not just about listing your tasks; it’s about presenting your accomplishments in a clear, concise, and impactful way that both the ATS and the hiring manager can understand.

**Clear, Action-Oriented, and Keyword-Rich Language**:

- **Use Action Verbs**: Start each bullet point with strong action verbs to showcase the impact you’ve made. Examples include:
  - Managed, Led, Developed, Improved, Analyzed, Implemented.
- **Incorporate Relevant Keywords**: Use industry-specific terms that match the job description. If you’re applying for a technical role, make sure you’re speaking the language of that industry. Keywords are essential for ATS and also show the hiring manager that you’re aligned with the role.

- **Be Concise**: Keep each bullet point focused on your measurable achievements. Avoid lengthy sentences and focus on the results you delivered.

**Example**:  
Instead of:  
“I was responsible for managing the project team and ensuring the timely delivery of all project milestones.”  
Use:  
“Led a project team of 10, ensuring 100% on-time delivery of key milestones.”

### **Structure**

Your resume’s structure is just as important as the content itself. It needs to be logical, clear, and consistent so both the ATS and the hiring manager can easily navigate through your experience and skills.

**Standard, Logical, and Consistent Structure**:

- **Clear Sections**: Stick to traditional section titles like “Experience,” “Education,” “Skills,” and “Certifications.” Creative labels such as “My Journey” or “Professional Adventures” might sound interesting, but they can confuse ATS systems and hiring managers.  
  **Examples of Section Headings**:
  - Experience
  - Skills
  - Education
  - Certifications
- **Bullet Points Over Paragraphs**: Bullet points make it easier to quickly scan your achievements. Long paragraphs can be overwhelming and harder to process, both for ATS and humans.
- **Chronological or Functional Format**: Stick to reverse-chronological (most recent job first) or functional (skills-focused) formats. These are the most common and easily understood by ATS systems.

**Example**:  
**Experience**_Company Name_, Project Manager _(Jan 2020 – Present)_

- Managed cross-functional teams to deliver 15+ projects, increasing efficiency by 20%.
- Developed project timelines, reducing delivery delays by 30%.

### **Font Types**

You might not think about it, but the font you use can make or break your resume’s readability—both for humans and ATS systems.

**Simple, Professional, and Readable Fonts**:

- **Sans Serif Fonts**: These fonts are modern, clean, and highly readable by ATS systems. Examples include:
  - _Arial_: Classic and professional.
  - _Calibri_: A modern and easy-to-read font.
  - _Helvetica_: Known for its clarity and simplicity.
- **Serif Fonts**: While less common, serif fonts can still be used if they are clean and simple.
  - _Times New Roman_: A traditional, professional choice.
  - _Georgia_: Slightly more modern, but equally readable.
- **Font Size**: For body text, use size 9-12, and for section headings, use a slightly larger size (10-14) to make them stand out.

## **Technical Resume: Tailoring Your Skills for STEM and Beyond**

A **technical resume** is typically used for roles in STEM fields—like data analytics, software development, engineering, IT, and more. These resumes are highly specific and emphasize technical skills, certifications, and projects that directly relate to the job you’re applying for. While experience still matters, **the projects you’ve completed and the certifications you hold** often carry more weight with hiring managers in technical fields.

### **Key Elements of a Technical Resume:**

1.  **Technical Skills Section**: This is non-negotiable. You need to clearly list out the programming languages, software tools, and other technical proficiencies you have. Hiring managers want to quickly scan this section to see if you have the foundational knowledge they require.
2.  **Certifications**: Whether it’s a certification in Python, AWS, or project management, certifications demonstrate both your expertise and commitment to continuous learning. They also prove that you meet industry standards for certain technical skills.
3.  **Projects**: These are the bread and butter of a technical resume. Projects show what you can do with the skills you’ve acquired. Not only do they validate your experience, but they also provide the hiring manager with tangible examples of how you apply your knowledge to solve problems.

#### **Example of a Technical Resume:**

Let’s take a look at how you would frame your experience in a **software development** role.

**Experience**_XYZ Corporation\_\_Software Developer (June 2020 – Present)_

- Developed a cloud-based microservices architecture, increasing system scalability by 30%.
- Led a team of 5 developers in the migration of legacy systems to modern cloud infrastructure (AWS), reducing operational costs by 15%.
- Integrated CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment, reducing release cycles from two weeks to three days.

**Projects**

1.  **Real-Time Data Processing App**
    - Developed a real-time data processing application using **Python** and **Apache Kafka**, enabling real-time analytics on streaming data for a healthcare provider.
    - Implemented data transformation and validation pipelines, reducing processing time by 40%.
    - **Key Skills**: Python, Apache Kafka, Data Analytics, Cloud Infrastructure.
2.  **E-Commerce Recommendation Engine**

    - Used **Python** and **TensorFlow** to build, train, and optimize the recommendation model.
    - **Key Skills**: Machine Learning, Python, TensorFlow, Data Analytics.
3.  **AWS Cloud Migration**

    - Utilized **EC2**, **S3**, and **Lambda** services for optimal performance and scalability.
    - **Key Skills**: AWS, Cloud Architecture, EC2, S3, Lambda.

### **Why Projects Matter**

In technical fields, **projects** often carry more significance than just job titles. Hiring managers are looking for concrete evidence of how you can apply your technical skills in real-world situations. For example, if a job posting mentions cloud migration or machine learning expertise, and you have a project that directly aligns with those tasks, you’re much more likely to stand out.

Certifications also play a critical role. They serve as proof that you’re up-to-date with the latest industry tools and technologies. Having a **Google Data Analytics certification** or **AWS Solutions Architect** certification shows the employer that not only do you have the skills they need, but you’ve also gone the extra mile to validate those skills through recognized institutions.

When crafting a technical resume, always think about how your projects and certifications relate directly to the role you’re applying for. The more relevant and specific they are, the better your chances of impressing the hiring manager. Remember, they’re not just looking at your job titles—they want to know if you’ve successfully implemented solutions similar to what their company needs. If you can show them that you’ve done exactly what they’re looking for in a previous project, they may go to great lengths to hire you.

## **Non-Technical Resume: Highlighting Experience Over Projects**

A **non-technical resume** is typically used for roles outside the STEM fields—think marketing, sales, human resources, business development, and education. These resumes focus less on technical projects and more on your experience, soft skills, and professional growth. That said, even some STEM-related roles, especially those in management or strategy, can fit into this category, where the emphasis is placed more on your overall experience than on individual projects or certifications.

In a non-technical resume, **experience** becomes the star of the show. Hiring managers are less concerned with specific technical proficiencies and more interested in your ability to adapt, lead, communicate, and drive results in a variety of situations.

### **Key Elements of a Non-Technical Resume:**

1.  **Experience Section**: This is where you show how your past roles have prepared you for the job at hand. The focus should be on **achievements**—what you’ve accomplished, rather than just listing duties. Employers want to see that you’ve made an impact in your previous roles, whether that’s by increasing sales, improving team productivity, or launching successful campaigns.
2.  **Skills Section**: While not as technical as a STEM role, you still need to highlight key skills that apply to your industry. These might include leadership, project management, communication, budgeting, or specific software knowledge like CRM tools for sales or Adobe Creative Suite for marketing.
3.  **Education and Certifications**: While certifications aren’t as essential as they are in technical fields, if you have any that are relevant—such as leadership courses, communication training, or specialized industry certifications—be sure to include them. They show you’re committed to personal and professional growth.

#### **Example of a Non-Technical Resume:**

Let’s look at an example for a **Marketing Manager** role.

- Spearheaded a digital marketing campaign for a national retail brand, increasing online sales by 40% within six months.

### **Why Experience Matters More in Non-Technical Resumes**

In non-technical fields, **experience** often speaks louder than any individual project. Employers want to know how you’ve handled diverse responsibilities, led teams, or driven business results in your previous roles. For example, in a marketing role, the fact that you increased sales by 40% through a strategic campaign is more impactful than listing a specific technical tool you used to do so. It’s about showing **impact**, **leadership**, and **the ability to achieve results**.

That’s not to say projects don’t matter at all in non-technical resumes—they just don’t take center stage. The key is to show how your experience has prepared you for the role you’re applying for. Focus on what you’ve accomplished, not just what you were responsible for.

Employers want to know how you’ve added value in your previous roles and how those experiences have prepared you for the position you’re applying for. Keep the language clear and concise, and always highlight the impact you’ve made. By tailoring your resume to emphasize your experience and achievements, you’ll stand out as a candidate who can deliver results and lead in a non-technical role.
