# Crafting the Perfect Resume Technical vs. Non-Technical Approaches

The job market has become increasingly competitive, and with more applications than ever flowing into companies, employers have turned to technology to streamline the hiring process. Enter the **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)**—a tool used by nearly every large company in the U.S. to manage and filter job applicants. So, if you want your resume to actually make it to the hands of a hiring manager, it’s critical to understand how to create an **ATS-friendly resume**.

## **What is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)?**

An [**Applicant Tracking System**](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/recruiting/what-is-applicant-tracking-system/) **(ATS)** is software designed to help employers manage candidates throughout the hiring process. It automates much of the recruitment process, from collecting resumes to filtering out applicants based on certain criteria. Today, 99% of Fortune 500 companies use an ATS to sort through the flood of resumes they receive daily. These systems help companies streamline their hiring, especially when faced with hundreds (or even thousands) of applicants per job posting.

But while the ATS is a helpful tool for recruiters, it can be a frustrating barrier for job seekers. Many candidates fear their resumes will never make it past the ATS, meaning their skills and experience may never be seen by human eyes. Unfortunately, that fear isn’t entirely unfounded. ATS software scans resumes for specific keywords, phrases, and formatting. If your resume doesn’t match the job description closely enough, it can be automatically filtered out before it reaches a recruiter’s desk.

## **Why Do Employers Use ATS?**

ATS helps employers in several ways:

- **Efficiency**: Sorting through hundreds of resumes manually is impossible for large companies. ATS automates this process, making recruitment faster.
- **Standardization**: ATS ensures that only resumes that match the job description move forward in the hiring process, creating a more standardized way to evaluate candidates.
- **Keyword Matching**: ATS uses algorithms to match resumes with keywords from the job description. Resumes with the right keywords rank higher, while others may be automatically rejected.

While this sounds great for employers, it poses a challenge for job seekers who have to navigate this digital gatekeeper. Crafting an ATS-friendly resume is all about understanding how these systems work and making sure your resume plays by their rules.

## **ATS for Job Seekers: The Reality**

For job seekers, the reality is that ATS plays a big role in determining whether your resume is even seen by a human recruiter. Larger companies rely on these systems to filter out resumes that don’t match their criteria. While it may seem unfair that software is “judging” your qualifications, it’s a necessity for businesses handling hundreds of applications at a time.

In my experience working with ATS systems, recruiters have plenty of customization options. They can input keywords, specific phrases, and even technical terms or university names to fine-tune the system’s filtering process. This means the system isn’t randomly filtering you out—it’s carefully matching your resume against the job description. But here’s the challenge: most resume creation tools that claim to make your resume “ATS-friendly” focus on broad industries, and that can be too generic. To really stand out, you need to tailor your resume to the specific job you’re applying for.

Even though ATS systems make the process more efficient for employers, they are far from perfect. According to a [**Harvard Business Review**](https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/hiddenworkers09032021.pdf) study, 88% of employers reported that highly qualified candidates were filtered out of the process because their resumes didn’t match the exact criteria laid out by the job description. For middle-skilled candidates, that number jumped to 94%. So, what can you do to avoid this fate?

## **How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly**

Here are some key strategies for making sure your resume makes it through the ATS filter:

### **1\. Keep the Formatting Simple**

First and foremost, your resume’s format should be as clean and simple as possible. Stick to default fonts (Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri) and avoid overly complex formatting. **Avoid columns, graphics, headers, footers, and tables.** These can confuse the ATS, which reads resumes from top to bottom and left to right. If your resume is split into multiple sections, the ATS might misinterpret the information, jumbling up details and missing key points.

Simple formatting, bold headers, and standard bullet points will help ensure your resume is readable by the system. Stick to traditional section headings like “Work Experience,” “Skills,” and “Education.” This gives the ATS a clear structure to follow.

### **2\. Tailor Your Resume to the Job Description**

This is one of the most important steps. You need to make sure your resume mirrors the job description as much as possible. **Why?** Because the ATS is specifically looking for resumes that match the job posting’s keywords and phrases. Here’s how to do it effectively:

- **Identify Keywords**: Carefully read the job description and highlight key skills, qualifications, and responsibilities. Look for repeated words or phrases, especially in the “Responsibilities” and “Qualifications” sections. These are likely the keywords the ATS will be searching for.
- **Match Your Experience**: Once you’ve identified the keywords, make sure they appear in your resume in a natural way. For example, if the job description mentions “project management” and you have that experience, be sure to explicitly list it. Use the exact phrases from the job description to describe your skills and experiences.
- **Highlight Relevant Projects**: Projects are a great way to match specific job duties. If the job requires experience managing projects on time and within budget, make sure your resume highlights projects where you’ve demonstrated these skills.

### **3\. Use Standard Headings**

ATS software often looks for specific headings in your resume to categorize your information. Stick to standard section titles like:

- Work Experience
- Skills
- Education
- Certifications Using unconventional headings like “My Achievements” or “Capabilities” could confuse the system, and your experience might not be categorized correctly.

### **4\. Avoid Overly Fancy Language**

When describing your skills and experience, **keep the language clear and concise**. Avoid overly complex words or creative job titles. If your job title was “Marketing Ninja” at a previous company, change it to something the ATS will recognize, like “Marketing Specialist.” Stick to industry-standard job titles and descriptions so the system understands exactly what you’ve done.

## **Example of an ATS-Friendly Resume**

To make this easier to understand, let’s break down an example. Suppose you’re applying for a Project Manager position and here’s the job description:

**Job Description:**

- Responsible for planning, directing, and coordinating high-level projects daily.
- Ability to think on your feet, communicate well, and lead by example.
- Completing projects within budget and on time.
- Reviewing and coordinating project specifics.
- Business development.
- Safety compliance adherence.
- Schedule monitoring.
- Reviewing safety plans and pay applications.
- Oversee all activities from start to finish.

## **How to Find the Keywords:**

- **Core Skills**: Planning, directing, coordinating—these are essential project management tasks, so they should appear in your resume under your experience section.
- **Soft Skills**: Think on your feet, communicate well, lead by example—these are important attributes that show adaptability and leadership, and should be highlighted in your resume.
- **Specific Tasks**: Budget management, safety compliance, schedule monitoring—these are specific tasks that demonstrate your ability to handle project specifics. If you’ve done similar work, make sure these keywords appear in your resume.
- **Full Involvement**: Business development, overseeing all activities—these show your engagement from start to finish, something the employer is likely looking for.

### **ATS-Friendly Resume Example:**

**Work Experience**

## **Conclusion**

In today’s job market, creating an ATS-friendly resume is no longer optional—it’s essential. With nearly all Fortune 500 companies using ATS to streamline their hiring process, your resume needs to be designed with the system in mind. By simplifying your format, tailoring your resume to match specific job descriptions, and carefully using keywords, you can increase your chances of getting past the ATS filter and into the hands of a recruiter.

Remember, while the ATS can be a challenging barrier, it’s not unbeatable. The more effort you put into crafting a resume that speaks directly to the job you’re applying for, the more likely it is that you’ll stand out—not just to the ATS, but to the people making the hiring decisions.
