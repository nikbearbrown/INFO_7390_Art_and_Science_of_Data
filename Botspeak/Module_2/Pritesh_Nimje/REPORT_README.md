# ðŸ“‘ Project Summary Report

## Abstract

This project, developed under OPT through August 2025, focuses on advancing **AI fluency and computational skepticism** by creating structured educational modules that integrate **philosophical foundations with practical AI validation techniques**. The work bridges theoretical insights from philosophy (Descartes, Hume, Popper, Plato) with hands-on methods in exploratory data analysis, validation frameworks, and human-AI collaboration strategies.

The initiative is divided into two main modules:

* **Module 1:** *Botspeak â€“ The Nine Pillars of AI Fluency*, covering frameworks for critical engagement with AI systems, including communication, validation, ethics, and stochastic reasoning.
* **Module 2:** *Data Validation Techniques for AI Systems*, emphasizing dataset reliability, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and philosophical critiques of data objectivity.

Deliverables include **five detailed Jupyter notebooks**, **multiple instructional videos**, and structured weekly progress logs, collectively building a foundation for responsible and effective human-AI collaboration.
