# Flipped Interaction Pattern

The Flipped Interaction Pattern represents a departure from the traditional model of human-AI interaction by flipping the roles, placing the AI in a position to ask questions to the user in order to accomplish a specific objective. This innovative approach aims to foster a more interactive, engaging, and guided experience, where the AI actively leads the user through a series of inquiries to achieve a desired outcome or provide tailored assistance. In the Flipped Interaction Pattern, the AI takes on a more proactive role by initiating the conversation with a series of targeted questions designed to gather relevant information, clarify the user's needs or preferences, or guide them towards a solution. These questions are strategically crafted to steer the interaction in a meaningful direction, facilitating a dynamic exchange of information and promoting user engagement. For example, if the user seeks assistance with planning a trip, the AI might employ the Flipped Interaction Pattern by asking questions about the user's destination preferences, budget constraints, travel dates, and preferred activities. Based on the user's responses, the AI can then offer personalized recommendations, itinerary suggestions, or travel tips tailored to the user's specific requirements. By flipping the interaction model in this way, the AI empowers the user to actively participate in the conversation, shaping the direction of the interaction based on their input and preferences. This not only promotes a sense of agency and autonomy for the user but also ensures that the AI's assistance is aligned with their individual needs and goals. Furthermore, the Flipped Interaction Pattern facilitates a more guided and structured experience, allowing the AI to lead the user through a logical sequence of questions to achieve a desired outcome efficiently. This can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where the user may feel overwhelmed or uncertain about how to proceed, as the AI's proactive questioning helps to clarify objectives and provide direction. Overall, the Flipped Interaction Pattern represents a novel approach to human-AI interaction, leveraging proactive questioning and guided inquiry to enhance engagement, facilitate information exchange, and deliver personalized assistance. By placing the AI in a more active role and empowering users to participate in a collaborative dialogue, this pattern promotes a more interactive and user-centric experience, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness and utility of AI-driven interactions.

# Introduction to the Flipped Interaction Pattern Exercise

In the realm of Wordsville, a land where magic and curiosity intertwine, students embark on an educational quest under the guidance of Princess Prompter. This exercise embraces the Flipped Interaction Pattern, challenging students to become the masters of their learning journey by crafting their own questions.

## Objective

The core aim of this adventure is to nurture students' critical thinking and inquiry skills. By stepping into the role of question composers, they learn to traverse complex topics through a process of guided discovery, enriching their engagement and comprehension of the subject matter.

## Exercise Description

Assuming the mantle of explorers, students are tasked with unveiling the mysteries that lie within the various regions of Wordsville. Rather than seeking direct guidance, they will develop questions that lead them on a path to self-discovery and understanding.

## Scenario Assignments

Students, either individually or in groups, will navigate scenarios tied to distinct regions of Wordsville, employing questions to unearth essential insights or resolve challenges:

1.  **Mystery of OpenAI ChatGPT:** Tasked with exploring OpenAI ChatGPT, students delve into the realm of artificial intelligence, formulating inquiries to grasp how AI contributes to societal advancement.

2.  **Google Gemini's Treasure Map:** In Google Gemini, students encounter a treasure map pointing towards the fabled Knowledge Vault. They must construct questions to decrypt the map's clues and locate the vault.

3.  **Google Gemini's Lost Artifact:** The quest for a lost artifact that commands the power of virtual reality leads students through Google Gemini. Through strategic questioning, they aim to uncover its whereabouts and means of activation.

4.  **ChatGPT's Challenge:** Confronted with a technological dilemma in ChatGPT, students apply the Flipped Interaction Pattern to engage with experts, piecing together information to forge a resolution.

# Guidelines for Crafting Questions

- Prioritize open-ended questions that prompt expansive explanations or narratives.

- Strategize the order of your questions, ensuring each builds upon the revelations of its predecessors.

- Exercise creativity and adopt diverse viewpoints in your inquiry to thoroughly explore the scenario.

## Reflection and Discussion

Post-navigation, students will present the questions they formulated and the revelations they encountered. This reflective session fosters a dialogue on the efficacy of various questioning strategies and the insights procured through this method of inquiry. By journey's end, students will have traversed the wonders of Wordsville, transformed from passive recipients to proactive seekers of wisdom. The Flipped Interaction Pattern enlightens them that the art of posing the right questions is as invaluable as the quest for answers themselves.
