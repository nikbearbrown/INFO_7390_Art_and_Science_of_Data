# Prompt Engineering Patterns: Short Definitions and Examples

1. **Persona Pattern**: Instructing the AI to adopt a specific role or persona.
   *Example*: "Act as an experienced quantum physicist explaining entanglement to a high school student."

2. **Audience Persona Pattern**: Specifying the intended audience for the AI's response.
   *Example*: "Explain blockchain technology to a financial professional who has no technical background."

3. **Flipped Interaction Pattern**: Reversing the typical roles where the AI asks questions and the user responds.
   *Example*: "You're a student studying climate science, and I'm your professor. Ask me questions about global warming."

4. **Game Play Pattern**: Structuring the interaction as a game with defined rules and objectives.
   *Example*: "Let's play a word association game where you respond with a related word, and we'll create a chain of 10 words."

5. **Template Pattern**: Providing a specific format or structure for the AI to follow in its responses.
   *Example*: "Answer my questions using this template: Context | Analysis | Recommendation | Implementation Steps."

6. **Meta Language Creation Pattern**: Establishing a specialized vocabulary or syntax for the conversation.
   *Example*: "When I type 'DEF:X', provide a definition. When I type 'EX:X', provide examples. DEF:machine learning"

7. **Recipe Pattern**: Breaking down complex tasks into clear, sequential steps.
   *Example*: "Give me a recipe for becoming more productive, with specific actions for morning, afternoon, and evening."

8. **Alternative Approaches Pattern**: Requesting multiple different solutions or perspectives on a problem.
   *Example*: "Suggest three different approaches to reducing employee turnover, from management, cultural, and compensation perspectives."

9. **Ask for Input Pattern**: Prompting the AI to request specific information needed to provide a better response.
   *Example*: "Help me troubleshoot my WiFi connection issues. Ask me questions to narrow down the possible causes."

10. **Outline Expansion Pattern**: Starting with a high-level structure and progressively adding details.
    *Example*: "Create an outline for a research paper on renewable energy, then expand each section with key points."

11. **Menu Actions Pattern**: Providing a set of options that the user can choose from to direct the conversation.
    *Example*: "I want help with my resume. You can: 1) Review my current resume, 2) Suggest improvements, or 3) Create a new template."

12. **Fact Check List Pattern**: Requiring the AI to verify its statements or list sources for claims.
    *Example*: "Explain the health benefits of meditation and include a fact-check statement for each benefit you mention."

13. **Tail Generation Pattern**: Using the beginning of a response to guide the AI in completing it in a specific way.
    *Example*: "Complete this paragraph about ocean conservation: 'The health of our oceans is critical because...'"

14. **Semantic Filter Pattern**: Setting constraints on the type or nature of content the AI should generate.
    *Example*: "Explain quantum computing without using any technical jargon or mathematical terms."

15. **Helpful Assistant Pattern**: Instructing the AI to behave as a helpful, honest, and harmless assistant.
    *Example*: "You are a helpful assistant. Help me understand the basics of investing for retirement."

16. **Real-World Implementations**: Applying prompt engineering patterns to practical, real-life situations.
    *Example*: "As a content marketer for a SaaS company, create three email subject lines that would increase our open rates."
