# Module 3: Bias Detection in AI Systems

## Overview
This module provides a comprehensive examination of bias detection methodologies in artificial intelligence systems. Students will develop expertise in identifying, measuring, and analyzing various forms of bias that can emerge throughout the AI development lifecycle. The module emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation of bias detection techniques, preparing students to conduct thorough bias audits and implement robust monitoring systems for AI applications.

## Philosophical Foundations
The module begins with an exploration of the epistemological challenges inherent in bias detection. We examine fundamental questions about measurement, objectivity, and the nature of fairness in computational systems. Key philosophical questions include:

- How do we define and operationalize abstract concepts like "bias" and "fairness" in measurable terms?
- What are the limits of quantitative approaches to detecting qualitative social phenomena?
- How do our detection methods themselves introduce bias into the evaluation process?
- What constitutes sufficient evidence of bias, and how do we balance false positives with false negatives?

We'll study perspectives from philosophy of science, critical theory, and measurement theory to understand how our detection methodologies both reveal and potentially obscure different forms of bias.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Design comprehensive bias detection frameworks for different types of AI systems
- Apply statistical and computational methods to identify bias patterns in datasets and model outputs
- Evaluate the strengths and limitations of different bias detection metrics and methodologies
- Implement automated bias monitoring systems for production AI applications

## Connection to Final Project

Students focusing on bias detection in their final projects should demonstrate mastery of the methodologies and tools covered in this module. Projects should include:

- Rigorous evaluation of multiple detection approaches and their trade-offs
- Discussion of philosophical and ethical implications of detection choices
- Implementation of automated monitoring capabilities where appropriate
- Critical reflection on the limitations and assumptions of the chosen detection methods

The final project should showcase not only technical competency in bias detection but also thoughtful consideration of the broader implications and challenges inherent in measuring and identifying bias in AI systems.
