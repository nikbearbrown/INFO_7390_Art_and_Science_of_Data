    "   B) Consistency\n",
    "   C) Positivity\n",
    "   D) Exchangeability\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answers: A, C, D**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation:\n",
    "   - Ignorability assumption implies that all relevant variables are included in the model.\n",
    "   - Positivity ensures that there is a non-zero probability of receiving all levels of treatment.\n",
    "   - Exchangeability assumes that treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes, given covariates.\n",
    "   \n",
    "____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are common causal inference methods used in observational studies?\n",

    "\n",
    "   **Answers: A, B, C**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation:\n",
    "   - Propensity score matching aims to balance covariates between treated and control groups.\n",
    "   - Instrumental variable analysis helps to address endogeneity by using an instrument that affects treatment but not outcome directly.\n",
    "   - Difference-in-differences compares changes in outcomes before and after treatment between treatment and control groups.\n",
    "   \n",
    "____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",

    "   C) Absence of confounding variables\n",
    "   D) Statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answers: A, B, C**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation:\n",
    "   - Temporal precedence asserts that the cause must precede the effect.\n",
    "   - Association between variables means changes in one variable are related to changes in another.\n",
    "   - Absence of confounding variables ensures that observed effects are not due to other variables.\n",
    "   \n",
    "____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n",
    "\n",
    "4. In causal inference, what is the purpose of conducting sensitivity analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "   A) To assess the robustness of causal estimates\n",
    "   B) To determine the statistical significance of the findings\n",
    "   C) To identify potential confounding variables\n",

    "\n",
    "   **Answers: A, C**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation:\n",
    "   - Sensitivity analysis examines how changes in assumptions or model specifications affect the results, testing the robustness of causal estimates.\n",
    "   - It also helps in identifying potential confounding variables that could influence the causal inference.\n",
    "   \n",
    "____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Which of the following statements are true regarding randomized controlled trials (RCTs)?\n",
    "\n",
    "   A) RCTs are the gold standard for establishing causality.\n",
    "   B) RCTs are always feasible and ethical.\n",
    "   C) RCTs are immune to confounding.\n",
    "   D) RCTs may not be generalizable to the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answers: A, D**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation:\n",
    "   - RCTs are often considered the gold standard because randomization minimizes bias.\n",
    "   - However, they may not always be feasible or ethical, and results may not be generalizable to the entire population due to specific inclusion criteria or other factors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Which of the following factors affect the validity of causal inference from observational studies?\n",

    "   C) Sample size\n",
    "   D) Randomization\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answers: A, B**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation:\n",
    "   - Selection bias occurs when characteristics of the sample differ systematically from the population.\n",
    "   - Measurement error introduces inaccuracies in data collection, potentially biasing results.\n",
    "   \n",
    "____________________________________________________________________________________________________________   \n",

    "7. What is the purpose of propensity score weighting in causal inference?\n",

    "   **Answer: A**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation:\n",
    "   - Propensity score weighting aims to balance covariates between treatment groups, mimicking the balance achieved in a randomized controlled trial.\n",

    "9. What distinguishes causal inference from association in observational studies?\n",
    "\n",
    "   A) Causal inference establishes a cause-and-effect relationship.\n",
    "   B) Association only identifies correlations between variables.\n",
    "   C) Causal inference relies on experimental data only.\n",
    "   D) Association analysis considers temporal precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answers: A, B**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation:\n",
    "   - Causal inference goes beyond identifying correlations, aiming to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between variables.\n",
    "   - Association analysis focuses solely on identifying correlations between variables.\n",
