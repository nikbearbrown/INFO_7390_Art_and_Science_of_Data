    "The CM 401(k) pension plan dataset, featured in the DoubleML tutorial, provides a rich context for analyzing the impact of 401(k) plan eligibility on financial assets. Utilizing a partial linear regression model, the analysis aims to isolate the causal effect of eligibility, adjusting for confounding variables through control covariates. This example underscores DoubleML's application in real-world economic research, highlighting its capability to address complex causal questions by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques within a rigorous statistical framework."

    "The provided code demonstrates the use of the **doubleml** library for various econometric and machine learning tasks. It begins by loading and exploring the 401K dataset from the **doubleml.datasets** module. A **DoubleMLData** object is created to organize the data for DoubleML analysis, specifying the target, treatment, and control variables. The code defines machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) for regression and classification tasks, which will be used as learners in the DoubleML procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then performs partially linear regression (PLR) analysis using the **DoubleMLPLR** class, including model fitting, accessing coefficients, standard errors, and summary. The code also conducts inference tasks for the PLR model, such as calculating confidence intervals and bootstrapping. Furthermore, it handles partially linear instrumental variables (PLIV) regression using the **DoubleMLClusterData and DoubleMLPLIV** classes, with simulated data and machine learning models for outcome, treatment, and instrument models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code demonstrates estimating conditional average treatment effects **(CATE)** with the **DoubleMLIRM** class, including group-based CATE estimation, confidence intervals, and CATE as a function of a continuous variable using spline basis functions. Additionally, it estimates quantile treatment effects (QTE) using the **DoubleMLQTE** class, specifying quantiles of interest and additional parameters. Overall, the code provides a comprehensive demonstration of the doubleml library's capabilities and its potential applications in econometric and machine learning analyses, covering various types of regression models, treatment effect estimation, and inference techniques.\n",

This whole process is then repeated 10000 times and the expected count turns out to be near 50% (i.e. the probability of these two variables attaining the same value at random). So statistically speaking, we have no definite conclusion at this stage. Thus assigning rooms different to what a customer had reserved during his booking earlier, may or may not lead to him/her cancelling that booking."

    "In this scenario, the treatment refers to the type of room reserved by the customer during the booking process. The outcome is determined by whether the booking was cancelled or not. Common causes are variables that we believe have a causal impact on both the outcome and the treatment. According to our causal assumptions, the two variables that meet this criteria are 'Booking Changes' and 'Unobserved Confounders'. If we don't explicitly specify the graph (which is not recommended), we can provide these parameters in the function below.\n",
