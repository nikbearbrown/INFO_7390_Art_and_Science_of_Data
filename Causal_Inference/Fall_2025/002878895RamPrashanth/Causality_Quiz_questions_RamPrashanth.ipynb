The primary focus of the analysis was on the effect of smoking cessation.\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** The script explicitly states this is the main causal question of interest, where 'qsmk' is the treatment and 'wt82_71' is the outcome.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** The dataset includes income and death, but the worked example specifically focuses on the relationship between smoking cessation and weight change.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** This question addresses the relationship between a confounder (wt71) and the treatment (qsmk), but it is not the main causal effect being measured.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 2\n\n**In the context of causal inference, what is a **confounder**?**\n\n💡 *Hint: Think about what a variable must do to create a spurious, non-causal association between the treatment and the outcome.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** A variable that is only affected by the treatment and then affects the outcome.\n\n**B.** A variable that causes both the treatment and the outcome.\n\n**C.** A variable whose value is missing for a significant number of observations.\n\n**D.** The primary variable of interest that the researcher is manipulating.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **B**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** This describes a mediator variable, which is a step in the causal pathway from treatment to outcome, not a confounder.\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** This is the precise definition of a confounder, as it opens a 'backdoor path' creating a spurious association between treatment and outcome.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** This describes missing data, which is a data quality issue, but not the causal role of a confounder.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** This describes the treatment or exposure variable, not the definition of a confounder.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 3\n\n**Why is **Age** considered a major confounder in the analysis of quitting smoking on weight gain?**\n\n💡 *Hint: Recall how age affects both the likelihood of engaging in the behavior (smoking) and the body's natural processes (metabolism).*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** Because Age directly determines the treatment, meaning older people always quit smoking.\n\n**B.** Because Age is related to both the probability of quitting smoking and the metabolic rate (which affects weight gain).\n\n**C.** Because it is required to calculate the Adjusted R-squared in the regression model.\n\n**D.** Because the naive comparison showed quitters are younger, which balances the groups.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **B**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** While age is associated with treatment, it does not determine it, and this statement is too strong and factually incorrect.\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** The script specifically points out that Age affects 'the smoking urge' (treatment) and 'metabolism' (outcome), fitting the definition of a confounder.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** While age is used in the regression, this describes a statistical requirement, not its role as a causal variable (a confounder).\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** The naive comparison showed quitters are *older* (46.17 vs. 42.79), confirming it's a source of imbalance, not balance.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 4\n\n**The **naive effect** (simple difference in means) showed that quitters gained **2.54 kg** more than non-quitters. Why is this estimate considered **biased**?**\n\n💡 *Hint: Consider the core problem that causal inference methods (like regression and IPW) are designed to solve.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** It fails to account for influential outliers with extreme weight changes.\n\n**B.** It only measures association and does not control for the systematic differences (confounders) between the quitters and non-quitters.\n\n**C.** It uses the mean instead of the median, which is less robust to skewed weight distributions.\n\n**D.** It is based on OLS regression, which assumes linearity and normality of residuals.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **B**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** While outliers can affect mean estimates, the primary reason for bias in this context is confounding, not specifically outliers.\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** The naive estimate is biased because it includes both the true causal effect and the spurious effect introduced by backdoor paths (confounders).\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** The choice between mean and median is about central tendency robustness, not the structural issue of confounding bias.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** The naive estimate is the simple difference of group means, calculated *before* running any regression model.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 5\n\n**In a Causal Diagram (DAG), how is a **backdoor path** from Treatment to Outcome blocked to achieve an unbiased causal estimate?**\n\n💡 *Hint: The solution requires actively doing something to the common cause node in the DAG to prevent the spurious flow of information.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** By observing or statistically adjusting for the outcome variable in the analysis.\n\n**B.** By setting the treatment variable to a fixed value for all observations in the dataset.\n\n**C.** By conditioning on (adjusting for) the variables that constitute the backdoor path (the common causes or confounders).\n\n**D.** By removing any observations that have missing values for the confounders.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **C**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** The outcome is the variable being measured; adjusting for it will bias the causal effect (M-bias or collider bias).\n\n**B. ❌ Incorrect:** Fixing the treatment is the counterfactual step, but the path is blocked by controlling for the *confounder* node, not the treatment node.\n\n**C. ✅ CORRECT:** Adjusting for a common cause (confounder) closes the spurious path $T \\leftarrow C \\rightarrow O$, isolating the true causal effect $T \\rightarrow O$.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** Removing missing data addresses data quality, but does not inherently close the causal path via the remaining observations.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 6\n\n**What is the primary role of **Regression Adjustment (OLS)** in estimating the causal effect of quitting smoking?**\n\n💡 *Hint: Think about what the multiple regression equation does to the coefficient of the treatment variable when many other variables are included.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** To calculate the propensity score for each individual in the dataset.\n\n**B.** To compare people who are different in the confounders and who both quit smoking.\n\n**C.** To statistically 'hold constant' the values of all measured confounders while estimating the difference in outcome between treated and control groups.\n\n**D.** To visually represent the distribution of the treatment variable across all confounders.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **C**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** Propensity scores are calculated using Logistic Regression (Logit), not Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.\n\n**B. ❌ Incorrect:** The goal is to compare groups that are *similar* in confounders but *different* in treatment (quit vs. not quit).\n\n**C. ✅ CORRECT:** This describes the mechanism of OLS: the coefficient for the treatment variable ($qsmk$) represents the effect when all other variables (confounders) are equal.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** Visualization (like the Love plot) helps check balance, but this is not the function of the regression model itself.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 7\n\n**The **Propensity Score (PS)** is calculated using a logistic regression with the formula $P(\\text{Treatment}=1 | \\text{Confounders})$. What does an individual's PS of **0.85** signify?**\n\n💡 *Hint: The PS is a probability, and the dependent variable in the logistic regression is the treatment status ($qsmk$).*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** They had an 85% chance of gaining 2.54 kg of weight.\n\n**B.** They had an 85% chance of *quitting smoking*, given their baseline characteristics (confounders).\n\n**C.** They are a highly influential observation and should be removed from the dataset.\n\n**D.** They are in the control group (Did Not Quit) and should have a high IPW weight.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **B**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** The PS is the probability of receiving the treatment (quitting), not the probability of the outcome (weight gain).\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** The PS is the estimated probability of the treatment being received, conditional on the observed confounders.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** A PS of 0.85 indicates a relatively common case (expected to quit), not necessarily an influential one. Cases with PS close to 0 or 1 get high IPW weights.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** A high PS suggests they are likely to quit (treated). If they did *not* quit (control), then they would have a very high IPW weight.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 8\n\n**What is the key objective of the **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)** method?**\n\n💡 *Hint: The goal of weighting is to adjust the balance of the confounders, making the non-randomized data behave more like a randomized experiment.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** To create a dataset where the outcome distribution is normal (Gaussian).\n\n**B.** To create a 'pseudo-population' where the treatment assignment is independent of the confounders (i.e., randomly assigned).\n\n**C.** To directly model the relationship between the treatment and the outcome using weighted ordinary least squares (OLS).\n\n**D.** To identify and remove all influential observations with extreme propensity scores.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **B**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** IPW aims to balance confounders, not to transform the distribution of the outcome variable.\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** IPW achieves balance by making the weighted distribution of confounders the same in both the treated and control groups, mimicking randomization.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** While IPW *can* use weighted OLS for inference, its primary objective is the *reweighting* step (creating the pseudo-population) to eliminate confounding bias.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** IPW actually *upweights* these extreme cases, it doesn't remove them. Truncation is a separate step to handle extreme weights.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 9\n\n**An individual in the **Treated group (quit smoking)** has a very low propensity score ($\\text{PS} = 0.05$). What does this imply about their IPW weight?**\n\n💡 *Hint: Recall the IPW formula: $W = 1 / P(\\text{Actual Treatment} | \\text{Confounders})$. How does a small denominator affect the resulting fraction?*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** Their weight will be very low, $1 - \\text{PS} = 0.95$, as they were expected to quit.\n\n**B.** Their weight will be very high, $1 / \\text{PS} = 20$, because they were an 'unlikely quitter who quit'.\n\n**C.** Their weight will be 0.05, as the weight is simply the propensity score.\n\n**D.** Their weight will be moderate, close to the mean PS of the dataset.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **B**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** This is the weight formula for the *control* group. A low weight is for common cases, not rare ones.\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** For the treated group, the weight is $1/\\text{PS}$. A low $\\text{PS}$ means they represent many similar people who did not quit, so they get a high weight.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** The weight is the *inverse* of the probability of receiving the treatment they actually got.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** Cases that behave contrary to expectation (low PS but treated, or high PS but control) get high IPW weights to correct the imbalance.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 10\n\n**What is the primary metric used to evaluate **balance** of the confounders *before* and *after* applying IPW weights?**\n\n💡 *Hint: This metric is used to measure the *size* of the difference in group means, scaled by the standard deviation, and is typically plotted on a 'Love Plot'.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** R-squared value of the propensity score model.\n\n**B.** p-value from a t-test comparing the means of confounders.\n\n**C.** Cook's distance for influential observations.\n\n**D.** The **Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)**, with a target typically below 0.1.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **D**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** R-squared measures the explanatory power of the PS model, but not the direct balance of confounder means between groups.\n\n**B. ❌ Incorrect:** p-values are heavily influenced by sample size; the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) is the preferred size-independent metric.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** Cook's distance measures the influence of individual data points on the regression results, not the overall balance of the treated and control groups.\n\n**D. ✅ CORRECT:** SMD is the standard metric used in matching and weighting to check if confounder distributions are similar across treatment groups, regardless of sample size.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 11\n\n**The analysis showed that the **Naive Effect** was $2.54 \\text{ kg}$, while the **Adjusted Regression Effect** was $3.41 \\text{ kg}$. What does this difference primarily indicate?**\n\n💡 *Hint: The bias is calculated as $\\text{Bias} = \\text{Naive Estimate} - \\text{Adjusted Estimate}$. The magnitude of the difference shows the extent of the confounding problem.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** The OLS regression model suffered from severe heteroscedasticity.\n\n**B.** The confounding bias was *negative*, causing the naive estimate to overestimate the true causal effect.\n\n**C.** The confounding bias was *positive*, causing the naive estimate to underestimate the true causal effect.\n\n**D.** A substantial **confounding bias** of $0.87 \\text{ kg}$ was present in the naive estimate.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **D**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** Heteroscedasticity is a violation of regression assumptions and does not explain the difference in the primary effect estimate.\n\n**B. ❌ Incorrect:** The bias is $\\text{Naive} - \\text{Adjusted} = 2.54 - 3.41 = -0.87 \\text{ kg}$. A *negative* bias means the naive estimate *underestimated* the true effect.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** The adjusted effect is higher ($3.41 \\text{ kg}$) than the naive effect ($2.54 \\text{ kg}$). This means the naive estimate was biased *downwards* (underestimated the true effect) by $0.87 \\text{ kg}$.\n\n**D. ✅ CORRECT:** The difference between the naive and adjusted estimate ($\\lvert 2.54 - 3.41 \\rvert = 0.87 \\text{ kg}$) is the estimate of the total confounding bias removed by adjustment.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 12\n\n**After successfully calculating the IPW weights, how is the causal effect (ATE) estimated using the weighted means approach?**\n\n💡 *Hint: The ATE is the average difference in outcomes. With IPW, you just need to ensure the means are calculated on the balanced, pseudo-population.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** By running a simple OLS regression of $\\text{Outcome} \\sim \\text{Treatment}$ without any weights.\n\n**B.** By taking the difference between the weighted mean outcome of the treated group and the weighted mean outcome of the control group.\n\n**C.** By summing the IPW weights of the treated group and subtracting the sum of the weights of the control group.\n\n**D.** By comparing the weighted median outcome instead of the weighted mean outcome.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **B**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** This is the naive, unadjusted approach, which does not use the weights calculated in the IPW step.\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** The difference between the two weighted means gives the IPW estimate of the ATE, as the weighting has balanced the confounders.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** Summing weights is not a measure of the outcome effect. The sum of the IPW weights across the whole population should equal the sample size.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** IPW is designed to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), which is based on the mean, not the median.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 13\n\n**The **Regression Adjustment** and **IPW** methods yielded very similar causal estimates (approx. $3.4 \\text{ kg}$). What is the main implication of this agreement?**\n\n💡 *Hint: Think about what it means when two different statistical 'routes' lead to the same destination. What does that tell you about the path?*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** It proves that the non-linear relationship between confounders and the outcome is negligible.\n\n**B.** It suggests the regression model was likely correctly specified, increasing confidence in the final causal estimate.\n\n**C.** It means the causal effect is not statistically significant and should be discarded.\n\n**D.** It indicates the initial step of dropping missing data was performed correctly.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **B**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** The agreement only suggests both models correctly handled confounding; it does not explicitly rule out non-linear relationships.\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** When different methods that rely on different assumptions (e.g., OLS needs correct outcome modeling, IPW needs correct PS modeling) agree, it strengthens the finding.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** The similarity of results does not determine statistical significance, and the reported p-value suggests the effect is highly significant.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** This agreement is about the *estimate* derived from the available data, not the missing data handling procedure.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 14\n\n**The final causal estimate was $\\mathbf{3.41 \\text{ kg}}$ with a $\\mathbf{95\\% \\text{ CI}}$ of $[\\mathbf{2.80}, \\mathbf{4.02}]$. What does this confidence interval mean?**\n\n💡 *Hint: A confidence interval is an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, not a range for individual observations.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** 95% of the individuals in the sample gained weight between 2.80 kg and 4.02 kg.\n\n**B.** There is a 95% probability that the true average causal effect of quitting smoking in the population is between 2.80 kg and 4.02 kg.\n\n**C.** It suggests the result is not statistically significant because the interval contains the mean (3.41 kg).\n\n**D.** The confounding bias is guaranteed to be less than 4.02 kg.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **B**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** The CI is a statement about the population mean, not the range of individual data points in the sample.\n\n**B. ✅ CORRECT:** The CI means that if you repeated the study many times, 95% of the CIs constructed would contain the true population effect.\n\n**C. ❌ Incorrect:** The result is statistically significant because the interval **does not contain zero**, indicating a real effect.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** The CI is for the causal effect itself, not an estimate of the remaining confounding bias.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\n## Question 15\n\n**In the OLS Regression Diagnostics, what would a distinct 'cone' shape in the **Scale-Location Plot** (Residuals vs. Fitted Values) primarily suggest?**\n\n💡 *Hint: This plot helps determine if the spread of the error terms is consistent across all predicted values of the outcome.*\n\n\n### Answer Options:\n\n**A.** Violation of the assumption of linearity, suggesting a need for polynomial terms.\n\n**B.** Violation of the assumption of normally distributed residuals.\n\n**C.** Violation of the assumption of **homoscedasticity** (constant variance of errors).\n\n**D.** The presence of highly influential observations (high leverage points).\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>👉 Click here to reveal the answer</b></summary>\n\n### ✅ Correct Answer: **C**\n\n### 📖 Detailed Explanations:\n\n**A. ❌ Incorrect:** Non-linearity usually appears as a curved pattern in the Residuals vs. Fitted Values plot, not the Scale-Location plot.\n\n**B. ❌ Incorrect:** Normality is best checked using the Q-Q Plot and the residuals histogram.\n\n**C. ✅ CORRECT:** The Scale-Location plot checks for homoscedasticity, and a 'cone' shape (variance increasing or decreasing with fitted values) indicates heteroscedasticity.\n\n**D. ❌ Incorrect:** Influential observations are best assessed using metrics like Cook's distance, not primarily the Scale-Location plot.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n---\n"
