    "### 2.3 Types of Treatment Effects in Causal Inference {#effects}\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are \"Treatments\" in Causal Inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "In causal inference, a **treatment** refers to the intervention or manipulation being studied to determine its causal effect on an outcome of interest. Despite the medical-sounding terminology, treatments extend far beyond healthcare settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Medical interventions (medications, surgical procedures)\n",
    "- Policy changes (minimum wage increases, educational reforms)\n",
    "- Business decisions (pricing strategies, marketing campaigns)\n",
    "- Social interventions (training programs, behavioral modifications)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **treatment variable** typically represents whether subjects received the intervention, usually coded as a binary variable (1=received treatment, 0=control/placebo), though it can sometimes be categorical for different treatment types or doses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Calculate Treatment Effects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Treatment effects measure the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome. We calculate them to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establish causality, not just correlation**: Determine the independent effect of a treatment when other factors are controlled for\n",
    "2. **Understand counterfactuals**: Estimate what would have happened to treated units had they not received treatment (and vice versa)\n",
    "3. **Quantify impact**: Measure not just whether an intervention worked, but how well it worked and for whom\n",
    "4. **Inform decision-making**: Make better decisions about implementing interventions and targeting specific populations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Treatment Effect Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average Treatment Effect (ATE):**\n",
    "The average effect of the treatment across the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ ATE = E[Y(1) - Y(0)] \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where Y(1) represents the potential outcome if treated, and Y(0) represents the potential outcome if not treated. This measures the expected difference in outcomes if everyone in the population received treatment versus if no one did.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE):**\n",
    "The average effect of the treatment conditional on specific covariates or characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ CATE(X=x) = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X=x] \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This measures how treatment effects vary across different subgroups defined by characteristics X. CATE helps identify which groups benefit most from treatment, enabling more targeted interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT/ATET):**\n",
    "The average effect among those who actually received the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ ATT = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | T=1] \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This answers: \"How much did those who received the treatment actually benefit?\" It's particularly useful when evaluating programs that were targeted at specific populations or when treatment assignment wasn't random.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges in Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental challenge is that we never observe both potential outcomes for the same unit—known as the \"fundamental problem of causal inference\". Various methods address this challenge, including:\n",

The propensity score represents the probability of receiving treatment given a set of observed covariates.\n",

    "    2. **Causal Estimands**: We've defined multiple estimands of interest, with the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) as our primary focus. The ATE represents the expected change in cognitive scores if the entire population received the treatment versus if none did.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **ATT vs ATE**: The Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) is very close to the ATE in this dataset (difference of only 0.0041). This suggests that the treatment effect is relatively homogeneous across the population, or that selection into treatment wasn't strongly related to treatment effect heterogeneity.\n",

    "    4. **Naive Estimate**: The naive difference in means is similar to the true ATE in this dataset. This is somewhat unexpected, as we would typically expect selection bias to create a difference between the naive estimate and the true causal effect. This similarity could be a characteristic of how the semi-synthetic dataset was generated.\n",

    "        1. **Naive Mean Difference**: The naive estimate has a bias of {biases[0]:.4f}, which is {abs_biases[0]:.4f} in absolute terms. This is relatively {'small' if abs_biases[0] < 0.1 else 'moderate' if abs_biases[0] < 0.5 else 'large'}, suggesting that selection bias in this dataset may not be very strong.\n",

    "        2. **Regression Adjustment**: This method has a bias of {biases[1]:.4f} (absolute: {abs_biases[1]:.4f}), {'improving upon' if abs_biases[1] < abs_biases[0] else 'performing worse than'} the naive estimator. This {'improvement' if abs_biases[1] < abs_biases[0] else 'decline'} in performance suggests that the linear model {'adequately' if abs_biases[1] < abs_biases[0] else 'inadequately'} captures the relationship between covariates and outcomes.\n",

    "        3. **Stratification**: This approach has a bias of {biases[2]:.4f} (absolute: {abs_biases[2]:.4f}), {'outperforming' if abs_biases[2] < min(abs_biases[0], abs_biases[1]) else 'underperforming compared to'} the other methods. Stratification by birth weight reveals some heterogeneity in treatment effects across strata, which is valuable information for targeting interventions.\n",

However, all methods show relatively small bias, suggesting that the selection mechanism in this semi-synthetic dataset may not induce strong confounding.\n",

    "        **Advanced ML Methods**\n",

    "\n",
    "        1. **Untestable Assumptions**: Remember that unconfoundedness/ignorability cannot be directly verified from observed data; domain knowledge is essential for justifying this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. **Semi-Synthetic Nature**: Our IHDP dataset is semi-synthetic, allowing us to know true effects; in real applications, ground truth is unknown and evaluation is more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. **External Validity**: Causal effects estimated from a specific population may not generalize to different populations with different covariate distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. **Extreme Propensity Scores**: Units with very high or low propensity scores can lead to unstable estimates in methods like IPW; trimming or stabilization should be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "        5. **Computational Requirements**: Advanced ML methods offer improved performance but at the cost of greater computational complexity and reduced interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "        6. **Target Estimand Clarity**: Different methods may target different estimands (ATE, ATT, CATE); ensure the chosen methods align with the specific causal question of interest.\n",

    "    This comparative analysis across all implemented methods reveals several key patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Method Sophistication vs. Performance**: While advanced ML methods generally perform well, certain simpler methods (like Regression Adjustment) can achieve comparable results when relationships are approximately linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Low Selection Bias Impact**: The relatively small bias of even the naive method suggests moderate selection bias in this dataset, which explains why even simple methods can perform adequately.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Heterogeneity Insights Matter**: Beyond just bias reduction, methods like Causal Forests provide valuable insights into effect heterogeneity that can guide targeted interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Method Selection Considerations**: The \"best\" method depends on the specific context, goals, and constraints. Factors like interpretability, computational complexity, and the specific causal questions should guide method selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Multiple Methods Approach**: Using multiple methods and comparing results provides more robust and trustworthy causal insights than relying on any single method.\n",
