Google Play,"I downloaded the Threads app with high hopes, but my experience has been quite disappointing. The app's lack of optimization is immediately noticeable – it feels sluggish and unresponsive. What's even worse is that the app crashes multiple times, making it incredibly frustrating to use. It's evident that the app contains numerous bugs and errors, which further hampers its usability. I really wanted to like Threads, but its current state leaves much to be desired. I hope the developers address th",3,27-08-2023 2:29

Google Play,Threads is thread bare when it comes to having the same key funcations as Twitter (X). Having no way to seach for key works makes finding profiles of random users a pain. Not being able to view your likes is also a pain. I will give credit that it now shows people you're following in a different tab.

Google Play,"UPDATE: i gave 4 stars up from 3 thanks to the follow feed. But i changed my mind. There's still no DM support, no hashtags, and worst, STILL no search except for accounts. Facebook has too much money and resources for this to be acceptable after all these weeks. This is a college students prototype app. If it fails, it will 100% be because the company just didn't give a damn anymore. 😞",3,05-08-2023 9:45
Google Play,"Better than my X. But... please change the logo from black and white - it's very hard to spot, looks too much like a lot of apps I don't look at very often. I suggest using the black background and coloured Instagram transition on the ""thread"", the same way the logo is on the apps startup screen. Then it'll stand out more amongst other apps.

No video autoplay; one should choose what they wanna watch, make the follow/followers section easily accessible, the search functionality should more or less be like Twitter's, heck, we should be able to read quote reposts etc. The long and short of everything is we need Twitter-like experience.

Google Play,"This app is very familiar to me and super easy to use. It's like Twitter without as many glitches and the other chaos now associated with that app. If you like Twitter, you'll love Threads. They are adding more features, so remember it is brand new (as of this review). One thing they need to update (and I'm hearing they will) is that the home Feeds tab doesn't necessarily show new posts from the accounts I follow.

I haven't seen the actual interface till now. Secondly now it says that my instagram account will be deleted if I delete Threads. That's totally unfair. On one hand I can't use Threads and on the other hand I can't delete it. So I am left with last option of uninstalling it. I was so excited at first but now I am totally disappointed.,4,24-07-2023 18:11

Google Play,This is a pointless add on. Seriously just give it up that Twitter beat you at the thread game. People who use Instagram really do not care about threads af of they do they already use Twitter. The interface is also bland the vid posts look clunky with the text posts and the interface just makes the expernce a treasure hunt that you did not want to go on. Scroll across nope! Just down and down and oops missed a post up up up. Hey where did the feelng in my thumb go?,1,24-07-2023 2:57

Google Play,I had high hopes for this app. Unfortunately there is way too many bugs that makes the user experience poor. Threads is also lacking on lots of features that Twitter currently has. The censorship and invasive data collection is also a big downside. The marketing made me believe threads would rival Twitter but I just don't see that happening.

Google Play,Allow users to register on the app without necessarily having to operate Instagram. The current model is intrusive. It hard to anonymously use your app like one does on twitter. Delink registration from Instagram. That's the primary reason why I uninstalled the app without registering. You're making it very easy to trace people,2,23-07-2023 9:06

Also considering this is owned by FB/Instagram, I'm not expecting this to get any better. Already bad enough I see posts from people THAT I DON'T FOLLOW, instead of the people I DO follow.

Google Play,Any potential thia app once had may have been wasted. Meta clearly rushed this app out the door without giving time to plan out and release updates at a good rate. It is ridiculously hard to grow on the app or see posts your actually intrested in. They don't even have an actual discovery tab or following tab. The apps been out for weeks now and has had virtually no changes. The lack of updates has killed any fun this app once had.,1,22-07-2023 17:37

Google Play,"This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform. AJ 505",5,16-07-2023 7:07

Account is attached to Instagram, so you'd have to delete your insta account to delete your threads one and there's trending tab of course.

Threads is a standalone app from Instagram that was designed to be a more personal and private way to connect with your close friends. It's a great way to share your day-to-day moments with the people who matter most to you, without having to worry about your posts being seen by a wider audience. Some of the things I like about Threads include: It's a more personal and private way to connect. Threads is only visible to your close friend",5,15-07-2023 2:24

Also, there is a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but it needs some polishing. Also, I wish there was an option to create an account from scratch instead of importing an Instagram account.",3,14-07-2023 12:46

Google Play,Its fine. Does it function? Yes. Is it a good social media platform? Absolutely not. The only people who ever pop up on the home page are people you followed from instagram or meme pages you have 0 interest in that only ever post about threads. Theres no algorithm to help you find new accounts you might like. If you're a small creator you'll get 1 like from someone who follows you on instagram and then your post gets buries.

Google Play,"A welcome option to get away from Twitter, but migration, though painless, comes without a few much needed aspects. Searching by keywords for posts about a subject can't be done. No option to see trending subjects either. And the app does not always keep its last position, resulting sometimes in restarting from the very beginning of your feed. The recent update fixed the jerky scrolling; everything else is pending more updates!",3,13-07-2023 21:28

Google Play,Great start for a positive space. Like many reviews so far there are things to add to the app to make it better. The search page is a bit bland maybe more like insta? A visual thing. Trending would be good on there too. And instead of the usual drab news stories why not the best most positive news stories circulating. The no ads is a winner for me though that will probably change. I have to say it is a breath of fresh air so far. But it needs to stay a positive place.,3,13-07-2023 16:23

It is said that I need to subscribe and give ID in order for me to have a display picture. Kind dumb and unfair,4,13-07-2023 10:12

Google Play,Want to like it so bad but it's not good. You can't search for anything but other accounts. You can't type in any words in the search bar and find other people talking about the same thing. Not trending topics. It's only a one timeline of people that threads suggests to you and its usually a celebrity or an influencer. The app isn't good.,1,12-07-2023 19:21

Google Play,This has potential but the app functions like it was designed by people who have never used social media. I lost count of how many features are missing. It's so limited for an app designed by a billion dollar tech company. It seems as though it was prematurely released to appease shareholders. It's very messy. I also don't like all the censoring taking place. Unless it's blatant hate speech no one should be censored. Let people discuss differing opinions and fix your app.,1,12-07-2023 14:31

Google Play,This is likely the most overhyped program in the history of forever. The news feed desperately needs filters and there's just not a lot of organization or structure to it. It's basically just a reformatted version of Facebook.,2,12-07-2023 4:29

Google Play,"An impressive piece of Spyware that's good at circumventing firewalls. Another app you'll want a separate phone for.

Google Play,Got app but it kept closing and refused me to set up an account no mater what I tried the app flagged me and that made no sense! I found another way and off I was made one post will wait and see if it gets noticed. As far as Facebook I don't use it much but probably more than I with threads will wait and see if they actually flag me for my one post ? Surprise surprise I finally decided to do a thread post and bam it never posted I didn't like Facebook much hate Twitter being run by Elon Musk.,1,11-07-2023 13:26

It's better than the bird app and will hopefully continue to improve.",3,10-07-2023 17:07

If we want to delete this account we have delete whole Instagram account which doesn't seems to be perfect way. If you see they are forcing us to stay in this app whatever may come. It's a pure scam.

I have got alot of problems using thread because we can't save photos here we cant enter and give a long space here that makes a problem. Along with that there are alot of problem this app can probably replace twitter in future 😔 yea I am also sad a out that but watching it's exponential growth over days I can easily predict it's potential in market. I hope thread can solve challenge user facing and makes a good user experience ✨,2,10-07-2023 11:32

Google Play,As of launch there is no way to sort your feed chronologically and no way to show just people you follow on your feed. As a result of this your feed is nothing but celebrities posting psusdo self help positivity and major brands trying their hardest to make painfully unfunny posts to get clicks. At the present there aren't true ads but when your feed consists primarily of brands and corporations making constant posts with no way to get away from them it's kind of the same thing but worse.,1,10-07-2023 5:39

In the middle of writing a post, the app closes down entirely and looses the content so I'm having to write it in my phone notes. If you write a long post, your phone keyboard is in the way as the Threads text box doesn't shift up the more you write, so you can't amend mistakes or text. I'm seeing a heck of a lot of posts from people I don't follow at all and have no interest in. A familiar, simple app though so I like it so far.",3,09-07-2023 9:58

Google Play,"so far, so good. there are still missing features in the app like DMs, camera, etc. (also the algo seems way off) but one thing i find disappointing is the dark mode feature. i've navigated the app to find the button to turn it on or off and sadly there isn't one. my phone (samsung android 9) has a theme on so it cannot turn to dark mode and it doesn't make apps turn to dark mode. please, please, please add a dark mode feature as it may help other users like me browse more comfortably!",3,09-07-2023 9:34

Google Play,Bad !!!! As hell. I will say that it can't delete the thread account... You have created instead it will delete your Instagram account too..! You can't delete them separately. You can't text anyone on threads. Wrist feature of thread is the deleting account. Mobs who are looking for thread do not install or create a account or it will ruin both of acc insta and threads's account. I regret getting thread.

Another option that I would like to see that Twitter had, is the ability to turn off rethreads from people I am following. I like to see direct posts.",3,09-07-2023 7:26

Google Play,"This app surprisingly is a lot like Twitter minus a lot of the negative stuff. But it's clean sleek you. I really shows you how little there is to do on either platform. You can't direct message anybody, it's even hard to see what my friends are actually saying. My whole feed is a bunch of people I've never met, I don't follow, and no one's reposting it that I follow. Overall a solid experience compared to Twitter but somehow this app makes you realize how boring it is.",2,08-07-2023 22:24
Google Play,Very bad terms and conditions,1,08-07-2023 22:23

Google Play,Threader is great but not perfect yet. Here's what @zuck needs to fix ASAP. → DM: allow us send direct messages on Threads. → Insight: we need to see analytics to measure growth → Cover: we need cover photos in our bios for proper branding → Quote Threads reader: we need to be able to see the quotes on each post → Media: Allow us check out only media on profiles (e get y). What else have you noticed that's missing that needs to be fixed ASAP?,3,08-07-2023 18:39

Also, you can’t delete your account if you sign in with your Instagram account without also deleting your Instagram account.",1,08-07-2023 16:02

Why you'd do something like this is beyond understanding and suggests a control freak approach. Not a great way to make a first impression.",2,08-07-2023 14:18

Way to go Meta. 4) Ability to translate from one language to another. 5) Videos don't have sounds in the owner's profile. 6) When commenting on a picture, you can't see what you are trying.",4,08-07-2023 12:11

Google Play,After a few days of using the app here are the things I hope to be updated. 1. For you feed. I see random people more than people I actually follow. 2. Hashtags. I think this will help with reach and engage with people of your niche. 3. Dark Mode option. 4. Gallery tab. It's frustrating having to scroll down just to find an image I wanted to post. 5. Writing a reply. I cannot see anything I write because the keyboard blocks it while typing. 6. Algorithm. Everything is so random at the moment.,3,08-07-2023 9:00

Google Play,"It's engaging and interactive. Since the app is still in its development phase, I won't comment on that. However, I wonder if there is any chance that our Instagram and Threads account could be independent of each other in future. Lots (like me) might have two different accounts on Instagram - maybe one for pictures, another being content specific (poetry, photography etc). But for Threads I would any day prefer just a single account in my name.",3,08-07-2023 6:50

Google Play,Absolutely fabulous first day. I did notice Elon's buddies coming over and complaining a lot when they went back on Twitter. But they get mad because they do s***** things and then get caught. Other than that it worked really good. Cons are it needs an edit button and it needs a way to select the type of things that you want to follow for example politics animals etc. Have a great day I was really happy to see everyone show up.,5,08-07-2023 0:31

Google Play,"While it is similar to Twitter, it is not exactly the same. Threads has a lot to offer and at the same time a little too much. I don't require the threads of people I don't follow and also has some security issues like it is possible to upload explicit images publicly and offensively criticising the threads but at the same time it diversified our opinions. It can be added as an extension to insta, which can make it more user friendly and if used appropriately it is a great app opportunity",2,07-07-2023 22:12

Google Play,"So, I'm wondering ... Is Mark willing to upgrade the trending algorithms? Because this is really a concerning issue.

Google Play,"It's actually really good and better than twitter, obviously I kinda expect y'all to keep adding to the app overtime, but my posts get no engagement at 0 followers. So that sucks.

Google Play,"The home page needs a huge adjustment. There's no logic to the content I'm seeing. There needs to be a way to cater what you're seeing. I only want to see the people I follow, that's why I follow them. It's a mess. Additionally, there's essentially no data privacy, so be weary. Also....you can't delete your account? What a misstep.",1,07-07-2023 19:30

Google Play,It's a good start but they have to add some thing before it can be great: 1. They need to add an option to see only people you follow instead of an annoying algorithm. 2. They need to let you mute all posts from languages you don't want or not know. 3. They also need to add option to change the name without changing the Instagram name. 4. Another useful think would be the ability to zoom on an image and staying zoomed without it snapping back to normal size. 5. They need a website.,3,07-07-2023 17:25

Google Play,Twitter but with more censorship and worse interface. It is altogether a very bad app and I would not recommend downloading it. You have to have instagram to even get into the app which is a pain. They will also deboost your posts and censor you from seeing others. Slow to load too. Stick with twitter as it is a much better app. Very bad do not recommend.,1,07-07-2023 16:22

Google Play,Pretty mid - concept is cool for those who basically want a PG/clean version of Twitter. Doesn't have direct messaging so no chance of strangers trying to scam you or sending you porn. But it links to your Instagram account so you can't delete your threads profile without deleting your Instagram profile too. Hopefully this mechanism will be scrapped and soon else I can see the app crashing and burning. But you can however deactivate the threads account without it impacting your Instagram.,3,07-07-2023 15:47

Google Play,"I love the potential of this app and can see myself use it more, but the only way that's happening is if my feed only shows me accounts I follow rather than having somewhat of an explore page on my feed. It's really content and information overload and we already have that with Instagram unfortunately - I don't think I can handle more without deleting one or the other. Please no ads or random algorithms, just a chronological feed of accounts I follow. Also surprised how hashtags don't work here?",2,07-07-2023 13:00

Google Play,"This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform.",2,07-07-2023 12:56

Might as well just remove this app threads. Instagram is being loved through posting pictures but it is very convenient for having conversations with reactions if you don't know what to say. Music for stories is also important to express oneself. I just hope the effect on the Instagram app is just temporary.",2,07-07-2023 12:52

Google Play,It's a clear ripoff of Twitter and Truth social. Alot of censorship of free speech to protect snowflakes who live in mommies basement shooting up redbulls and twinkies.,1,07-07-2023 12:04

Google Play,Nothing new 😞 I telling because I am the 1st Bangladeshi Who Log in to this app Zuckerberg copyed everything I guess Now he maybe 🤔 thinking Making A app like His own version of Tinder LOL.

Google Play,after downloading this app your messenger can experience error sending pictures and also instagram,2,07-07-2023 12:01
Google Play,It's a good start but they have to add some thing before it can be great: 1. They need to add an option to see only people you follow instead of an annoying algorithm. 2. They need to let you mute all posts from languages you don't want or not know. 3. They also need to add option to change the name without changing the Instagram name. 4. Another useful think would be the ability to zoom on an image and staying zoomed without it snapping back to normal size. 5. They need a website.,5,07-07-2023 12:01

Google Play,"I don't really see the appeal of this. Yeah it's a rival to twitter and whatnot but for now, it doesn't look too promising.

When u open it u prompt to login with Instagram You keep ur same user name and you can follow the people you are already following on Instagram if u wish...r u can recreat if u wish. U can add a bio automatically import from ig... At a very first glance it feels familiar They not inventing the wheel here. The design is minimum it clean and attractive,4,07-07-2023 9:43

Google Play,По суті це альтернатива твітеру. І зі своєю задачею типу писати пости і робити треди воно справляється. Але все таки є мінуси і як на мою думку не вистачає можливості завантажувати фото (як в тому ж твітері бо частіше всього я заходжу туди щоб скачувати всякі меми і фото з котиками) а також не вистачає гештегів. І хотілося щоб ця соц мережа була трішечки яскравіша :3. Надіюся з часом додадуть нові цікаві функції і ті про які я вже сказала.,4,07-07-2023 8:35

Because of Instagram's overly cautious account policy, I think Instagram itself treats Threads as a 3rd party app and because of it I've been getting constantly logged out of Threads as well as Instagram despite they are designed as intertwined apps.

Google Play,"My honest review, is that how it is and the idea they have of the app is perfect, following threads and about conversation. I don't think it needs DMs, and Livestream. ITS FOR CONVERSATION AND SHARING IDEAS ONLY. EASY PEACY. Cause what's the point of adding more things, it's gonna get like twitter in the future or later on instagram. I mean, there are already apps for that, let's separate things. I do agree that it could have an option of seeing feed from everyone and another of followers.",4,07-07-2023 5:54

Google Play,"-More than half the images make the app crash. -Some of the images that don't make the app crash seem to upload initially but then fails to upload -Only some images can be uploaded others (both jpeg and similar size) make the app crash. -Being able to choose folders in the device to share media files would be good instead of the most recent pictures. -Switch the account function would be useful, currently",3,07-07-2023 5:53

Google Play,What is this app trying to accomplish besides being a Twitter clone as soon as they started limiting users? Meta would rather jump in and create a new app for that scenario then go on about making their already existing platforms better. Guess blue checks sell more.,2,07-07-2023 0:34

Interaction bar needs to follow the comment, repost, like, share order like twitter though (it's more ergonomic to have the like button on the right side), and having the interaction numbers clearly visible instead of a dark grey which is hard to read. Still needs hashtags, a proper search feature, and trending topics. Need a home feed with only people I follow. Good for release, missing key features.",3,06-07-2023 23:32

Google Play,"I dislike that sharing a post is called ""repost"". As an artist, reposting a post usually consists of someone saving art and posting it to their own account. Sharing or ""retweeting"" is welcome, but reposting is a no-no. Why would this app call sharing ""reposting""?? It's unclear who gets the ""like"" when a post is shared. It should be the op. That is one thing IG does not get right (and Twitter does). I hope Meta gets it right. Option to delete threads account without deleting IG.",3,06-07-2023 23:15

Google Play,Create your own Lists is Not a Feature. Only Following permitted makes this like Other New Social Platforms. It's Limiting & Not Convenient like Twitter for Grouping Numerous Topics & User Sources to review Easily. Meta obviously linked Threads Platform with Instagram quickly with little Value of Users regarding Lists. Is Follow Only better for Digital Data Capitalism? Hopefully it will Evolve. Does Threads have Follow Limit like Twtr for Users with Few Followers which having Lists increases?,2,06-07-2023 21:38

However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience.

Google Play,"My biggest problem with Twitter is that it has no “edit” button and I am an impulsive commenter. This appears to be the case with Threads. For me, Facebook will always stand out for having this great feature. Sometimes, I deliberately post shabbily on￼ the App just to capture the musings. Knowing that I can always come back to flesh out what’s been wrongly done kind of endears the App to me. Mark Zuckerberg must quickly afford us this feasibility on the Threads.",2,06-07-2023 18:36

For example, when searching a topic, you don't find anything related to that topic, meaning anything that comes to you is via your main page, which incase lowers a lot of outreach and possibility of finding content that relates to you. Hashtags could called Threads and make it easier to find topics and such. Needs lots of work. It can be a good app, but it feels rushed.",3,06-07-2023 16:57

Google Play,"Dear founder of Thread Apps. So far I like the look of this app because it's a bit like a *blue bird one.* But, I'm not really satisfied by this apps because there's no pinned thread, i wanna pin something on my profile, so people who's want to follow me know about my account. My advice, please add the pinned thread feature, so it will make it easier for people to find out about my account or my personal backstory. Thank you so much for reading my review, i hope it reaches you.",5,06-07-2023 16:17

This app is a ploy for Zuckerberg to take over the Fediverse, but currently it's complete garbage. This app will not cultivate a real culture in its current form. Even the influencers themselves are complaining. Draconian Meta content rules still apply.",1,06-07-2023 14:46

Google Play,Pretty well to navigate. A little hard to branch off to find similar users. But my biggest hate and the reason why I give 3 stars is the constant spam of verified users that I don't care about. Their brands do not suit my taste and it's always a large scrolling process to skip past them.,3,06-07-2023 14:44

Google Play,"there's some flaws I've noticed . 1. Reply in thread goes far way bottom, not the below of the thread that meant to be replied 2. Text cursor doesn't follow my typing, need to scroll by myself if it's a long thread 3. I can't save images 4. can't 2x tap to zoom image, I must pinch it to zoom and it's doesn't stay still zooming the image, it always goes back to original size. 5. Video UI/UX is not very interactive and intuitive, can't tell the duration 6. No media bar in profile 7. No hastags",3,06-07-2023 10:10

Not impressed. Only using as I need to be across all social media but really not happy with my user experience on the first day of it going live, & don't like you have to tie it to the Instagram.

Google Play,Not twitter. Folk like me want to use it away from private and professional lives. Instead you want it linked to our Instagram where we liase with family and friends. Couldn't even set up a different Instagram account to keep my threads away from my personal life - critical for many of us to speak out worry free of consequences in a job or even with family beliefs. Threads will not see the large market of us on twitter who use it in an anonymous way. Instagram with words - useless.,1,06-07-2023 8:54

Google Play,If you have the sense of humor of a Hulu ad then this brand managers idea of a social media app is for you. Threads only exists for influencers and brands to talk at each other. You can't curate a feed so your generated on can be full of hate speech like mine was. Golly heck you can't even swear and explicit content is banned. You also need a separate account to sign up and you can't delete this profile without deleting your Instagram. Avoid.,1,06-07-2023 7:50

Google Play,"I'm still wary of this app. But it's very promising. I love the interface design though there's still room for improvement. I personally experience lags while scrolling and I find that hard to navigate when the app keeps doing that. I also think it's better to implement the new emojis on the app but as well for instagram, too. Creating an account is a hassle if you just want to make a fandom one. And I find it a hassle to go to another app just to change my display name. I hope that'll change.",3,06-07-2023 5:59

Google Play,"It's like Instagram except it's text instead of pictures, except the times you use pictures with text. Either way, it looks like Twitter. Instead of cloning somebody else's app, you should have just made your own. Social media is stagnant and Twitter sucks. Why would you think we would want another Twitter? Give us sync for Reddit comments and features mixed with Youtube, mixed with Instagram, and leave us alone. It also collects your data more than usual. Mark should pay us to use it instead",1,06-07-2023 5:56

Google Play,It's only just launched so I think we should give it a chance to grow but there's virtually no customization. You can't limit your feed to only accounts you follow and you can't create or filter your own feed via hashtags or keywords. This makes for a very bland and homogenized platform. The feed feels disorganized and strewn together with things I don't care about and don't find interesting. I would much prefer something that could be configured and adjusted to my own tastes.,3,06-07-2023 4:37

Makes following new people easier. So far so good. I'm a meta Share holder too so with this new app I'll be buying more stock options. Lol 😆",5,06-07-2023 1:59

App Store,"Hello, I am DPM DJ. I’d like to write a somewhat serious review on this app, so buckle in. First thing I notice when I go into the app is, “Hey. This looks a lot like Twitter. But…better?” Yes, it turns out that I have been enjoying this app more than Twitter and even Instagram to a certain extent due to the less toxic environment. Honestly, well done with that. This is the first time I’ve felt reasonably comfortable using a social media app. Second thing I notice…the absolute mess in my feed. Yes, I know that the app is fairly new, but my feed is looking kind of atrocious. Every time I refreshed my feed, hoping to see stuff from people I followed (which was probably around, if not over, 100 people) but was instead met with a crap ton of random people who had absolutely no affiliation with me or any of the people that I followed. That was kind of weird, but I decided not to mind that. Lastly, I decided to embrace the app’s less toxic environment, going around threads and seeing actual positive people and comments on each one. Long story short, this app is kind of like Twitter’s second chance or something, but made by a completely different social media company. Respect.",4,07-07-2023 15:58
App Store,"this app has an amazing feel , i really enjoy the layout it has , just generally how things are set up . but , there are many things i think should be added to updates further down the road . first off , theres no trending page . one of the things that was very useful to most people on twitter was the trending page , which is now replaced with a ""who to follow"" section , which shows up on your timeline as well . also , no dms !!! i get that its an instagram app , but i hate having to go back and forth between apps just to message someone . another issue i have is how you cannot set up and an account without having instagram , and how you cannot delete your threads account without deleting your instagram account . like i said , i understand that its connected , but itd feel a little more freeing , i guess , having the accounts be separate , or at LEAST being able to change your name/username without going into the instagram app . ALSOO , i hate how your timeline isnt , or is at least very hard to get , tailored to you . ive followed many , many people , and still get random people or celebrities ive never heard of popping up on my feed , with jokes or sayings i have no interest in . maybe its because the app is new , but i feel like a lot of other apps have adapted a lot quicker . despite these downsides though , i think the app is great . for what it has already , i havent noticed any actual issues with using it . no bugs or anything .",3,09-07-2023 5:35
App Store,"I’ve been hoping for something to replace Twitter and Facebook for awhile now (since Twitter was ruined and Facebook has been less and less personal for years) — so naturally Threads intrigued me. So far I’m cautiously optimistic, but it does bother me that it’s owned by Facebook/Instagram and the app is very minimal at the start. So we’ll see how it goes.

My wife and I both downloaded Threads within 24 hours of each other. I’ve had a positive experience with it so far, but for some reason her account showed her some very questionable stuff (three posts in around thirty seconds of scrolling). I’m guessing this is because I follow more accounts so I don’t see posts from unfollowed accounts, but it could also be due to Instagram privacy/security settings since many of those sync over.

My main concern at this point is with content visibility control. When someone I follow replies to someone I don’t, I should see a button to show the original post and not the full post by default. There should not be random posts on the feed, especially when they highlight risqué photos. Some people may like seeing unrelated posts, but there needs to be a simple control for seeing this or not. As it stands, my wife has deactivated her account already (less than ten minutes of use) and I may be following suit rather shortly. I understand it’s very new still, but this is important and needs to be addressed promptly for the sake of users and the platform.",2,07-07-2023 21:59
App Store,"If i could give it 0 stars I would. There are so many issues with this app. First of all, I couldn’t be logged into instagram and threads at the same time without getting automatically logged out of the other. The app in itself is poorly made, they made it so simple that it ended up not being user friendly. Forcing you to connect it to an instagram, keeping the same username,(some people enjoy privacy!), and impersonal timelines that are filled with unfunny verified accounts that are impossible to get rid of no matter how many you mute. You can’t even follow enough accounts you like to keep the stuff you don’t like off your timeline. Tried deactivating my threads account, not only will it not fully deactivate but you can’t remove the badge on your instagram no matter what you do, even though it tells you that you can. It just pops back up every time you restart the app or change tabs. I feel like i’m being forced to participate in something I no longer want to be a part of. This is such a terrible app I can barely put it into words. And to think that verified accounts had it before me and it still has all these issues is shocking. Very disappointing. Basically, if you like twitter, avoid this app. If you don’t like twitter, avoid this app. Even my LovenseRemote app is made better than threads.",1,08-07-2023 6:05
App Store,"Downloaded yesterday and I’m enjoying it for what it is so far; sign-up was super easy since you can import all your data from Instagram, and I love how you can directly access other accounts’ Insta pages to follow them there too.

My only issue is that the app feels a little bare-bones as of now. I understand it’s brand new and will be in the process of developing itself over time, but I’d love to see a bit more in terms of interface. The app feels a bit empty without a proper tagging system and it’s extremely hard for me to find new content and users to follow because my feed is mostly people I already follow on Instagram (plus random verified accounts and one or two new creators I find interest in). Please consider implementing a hashtag or keyword function for the Search bar (or maybe even an Explore page), and I’d probably find a lot more interest in the app!

Overall, this is a pretty decent start and I’m interested to see where it goes next… and to have a place to post my 3 AM intrusive thoughts.",4,07-07-2023 14:36
App Store,"If the best thing that can be said for Threads is it’s a “safe space” away from Twitter/X “toxicity”, one really needs to look inward rather than to an app to make one feel better or safer. After that there is the issue that Instagram and Threads cannot be logged in simultaneously, the early stage of development, it feels rushed out and not complete, just basic and simple. And more. Check other critical reviews, all valide points. Will it improve before daily user count falls off a cliff? 50/50. My bet is Meta will eventually throw in the towel as you never get a second chance at first impressions. The daily user count is rapidly trending downward in close proximity to introduction when it should be climbing upwards toward critical mass. Not a death knell, but a leading indicator of judgement by users. Meta should be increasing daily user count at this point, moving the needle in a positive direction. If there isn’t a community of sufficient size to not just maintain but grow daily users there will not be momentum to sustain it. You can either “Grow or Die”. There is no in-between, balancing on the head of pin. It’s going to take an enormous effort/change and differentiation to set Threads apart from alternatives just to turn the negative momentum around. Crystal balling today, Threads looks set to join the Metaverse in Metas portfolio.",1,04-08-2023 16:42
App Store,"I expect the posts on my feed to be from only the pages that I follow but what I get in addition to those posts is posts from pages that I don't even follow at all & have zero interest in following on Threads.  So Meta/Instagram/Facebook could fix that please.

The other thing is since I have two different Instagram & Thread accounts (one is my personal & the other is my artsy one that I use for arts & crafts, beauty, quotes, entertainment, & other fun, innocent stuff), I need a way similar to Twitter's way of switching accounts that makes it easier to switch accounts.

Other changes need to be made as well but these two are the ones I want the most.  I am not asking for perfection & the most perfect app since perfection is an overrated illusion, but I also understand that this is a new app & so there might be things to improve so I'm sure constructive feedback from users would be appreciated.",4,10-07-2023 20:17
App Store,"Its like Twitter... only its called Threads. The problem is that I dont see what void its trying to fill, or what problem its trying to solve, other than being another Twitter ""killer"" that is going to solve all the perceived non existent problems of Twitter (Remember when everyone was all excited over the Facebook Killers known as either Google Plus or Diaspora?). I also don't really see how it heightens or enhances instagram, either. Instagram is for all intents, well laid out despite the fact that you cant have a chronological feed that shows you everyone you follow (which it would be nice to scroll through my followers, and not my top interactions + whatever else instagram's algorithm tosses up). Btw, thanks for not allowing me to delete Threads unless I delete my Insta, there is simply no reason for that much tie-in. Regardless now I have a silly @ like symbol on my profile that redirects to a defunct threads link, so good job for useless features. Lastly, in regards to people complaining about toxicity on Twitter as a reason for this app to exist, I would suggest that Twitter is neither toxic or pure, but that most have no clue how go actually use it, as all algorithms are a result of what you, the user, put into it.",1,11-08-2023 13:14
App Store,"I will preface this by saying that I very rarely access social media; I use Snapchat for a handful of people and have a Facebook account for Marketplace. I am also NOT an Elon fanboy. The app is made very well, as Meta has quite a robust budget and talented programming team. Aside from that, I don’t like how the people you follow are shuffled between random check marks and that it’s unfiltered. Good for a basic, feed-central social media. With all that being said, this app will cause nothing but trouble. Elon Musk’s primary reason for purchasing Twitter in the first place was to divorce it from political power and fumigate the existing echo chamber. Less shadow-banning led to a more balanced ecosystem of opinions. Mark Zuckerberg, head of Meta which was known to sell user information and bolster an all around terrible support ticket system, is making a new “Twitter” right before an election cycle. I can’t wait to see how one-sided things shall be on Threads and not Twitter. I do not wish to continue using either app, however I feel as if a neutral opinion was warranted.",3,07-07-2023 17:28
App Store,"I enjoyed the onboarding experience of bringing in my Instagram followers. But then I was faced with an identity crisis. I’m a suburban mom on Instagram and an industry leader on Twitter. I don’t mix the two and it felt awkward. I trimmed some followers and found several Twitter friends.

I am irritated by the forced content from people I’m not following because it feels like I’m standing in the tabloid section of a grocery store. Facebook started doing this a few months ago and it drives me crazy. It is a constant stream of ads for brands and influencers I have no loyalty to. I understand that it makes the app more addictive and makes you feel like you have to constantly check it to stay up on the latest trends, but I quite Twitter because of this. I’m tired of hitting Mute and Block on Threads just to enjoy my feed of the latest trends in my industry. Let me curate my content and be intentional about what I consume. I really don’t want to know what Hollywood celebrities are doing. If this “feature” continues, this will be the reason I don’t use Threads.",3,07-07-2023 5:40
App Store,"I'm rooting for a Twitter replacement but threads it not it so far. The extreme connection to Instagram is really annoying. I want them to be separate, I don't want every change I make to have to reflect on both apps. I want separate usernames and pfps and I want it to not open Instagram every single time I want to change the smallest setting. 
It also desperately needs a ""people you follow"" timeline. It took only a few days for my ENTIRE feed to be absolutely zero people I follow and exclusively celebrities, brands, and influencers so until they implement a timeline change, the app is completely pointless and not really usable unless I want to spend several hours being nonstop advertised to. This could possibly work and take a lot of traffic away from Twitter as it descends into a bigoted trash heap but it needs an insane amount of work. Less hardcore connection to Instagram and better feeds. Otherwise it's just going to flounder for a while and eventually die as we all move back to Twitter or tumblr.",3,08-07-2023 14:39
App Store,"Threads is already a hugely better app than the dumpster fire that Twitter has become under the South African Blood Diamond heiress, space penis builder, and exploding car maker. It seems to operate smoothly, but there’s still a feeling of difficulty on how to post and repost like it is at instagram. I’m not sure if the hashtags are going to be as awkward either, as in more geared towards marketing than trending topics. This would all be easier to navigate if the app wasn’t showing up so small — basically smart phone size — on my tablet. I mean, I can just switch to my phone,  but yeah it bugs me when the size won’t integrate smoothly to the size of the screen. Otherwise, it’s a good app, and will likely replace Twitter in my social media time. Hopefully the size of the app to screen ratio is figured out quickly. I’m happy they provided a functioning app that’s not forever in beta.",4,15-07-2023 4:09
App Store,"so far, i am enjoying this app. obviously there are some features missing that i want, but it is good so far for it’s first update.

my one complaint about the current features though…the words i have hidden are still showing up on my timeline. this must be a bug, but it is a frustrating one, because there are certain posts i absolutely do not want to see and yet i’m still seeing them. i hope this can be fixed soon!!

otherwise, the algorithm seems much better to twitter, although it still needs some work. i’m looking for a following tab that hopefully i can make my default timeline, so i’m not seeing so many random accounts. i would also like a feature where you can switch between accounts easily, like on instagram, and i want their to be a close friends equivalent!",4,07-07-2023 14:45
App Store,"The threads app is the app everyone wants to love but they don’t give us any features that we need in order to love it. If you like a post, you have no history of your likes, so you can’t go back to it later. This is a privacy concern because you cannot track the posts that you liked. You can’t go deep in your settings somewhere and find this because it doesn’t exist. Facebook has always hidden features like likes in inscrutable settings that the average user cannot find. This is not a transparent solution. We need a separate likes tab and we need bookmarks for privately marking things. Also missing from the app are hashtags, anf any search whatsoever except for searching for names of accounts. There is no chronological timeline even though I thought that was promised in this version of the app, but it is not there in the update so far. Overall a disappointment of an app, unless you want to follow random influencers, sports accounts and famous people.",1,26-07-2023 20:09
App Store,"Threads, an app renowned for its unique features, has gained significant popularity and emerged as a preferred choice among users. Offering a range of advantages, Threads stands out as a superior platform. One notable aspect is its emphasis on fostering intimate and focused conversations, allowing users to create private groups and establish genuine connections. Moreover, Threads excels in content curation, providing personalized recommendations based on individual interests and preferences, resulting in a more tailored and enriching user experience. The app's intuitive design and seamless interface further contribute to a smooth and enjoyable browsing experience, setting Threads apart as an innovative social media platform. With its distinct features and user-friendly approach, Threads is redefining the landscape of microblogging and gaining recognition as a prominent contender in the realm of social media.",5,06-07-2023 18:52
App Store,"this is literally the better twitter. the community is less toxic and the app as a whole is just better. there’s way less ads which is also a plus. HOWEVER one of the main problems is in your main feed, there tends to be a bunch of random threads from people you don’t even follow or associate with who you follow. i do understand that this is a new app though and the algorithm is a work in progress which is understandable. one thing i think would make the app a little cooler, and even better than twitter, is if you had app theming, kinda like how you can theme the direct messages on instagram, but instead have it on threads, and have it be the whole app. (it would be really cool to open up a pink threads app 🤭) overall i think the app is really cool, good job 👍",5,18-07-2023 10:14
App Store,"I downloaded the app a few minutes after its public launch and have used it daily since then. I like the interface and the regular updates that add more functionality to the app. 
I think this could be the most viable alternative to the X app and I can already see that it is becoming and exciting progressive space. 
It is also heartening to know that the app is not at the mercy of the whims of a single owner but that there is a team behind it. It’s also good to know that the team is responsive to user suggestions and actually incorporates those suggestions in further development. 
Overall, I am hopeful that Threads will keep growing and become a vibrant space for a diverse community of users. 
Thank you so much, Meta, for creating this app!!",5,12-08-2023 14:02
App Store,"I managed to make a few posts, comments, and shares before it started to crash. I can view feeds and profiles and I can like posts but when I go to comment or create a post it crashes- app closes out. I have logged out and logged back in ( which worked once) and I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times. There isn't anything wrong with my internet connection, I have plenty of space, no additional apps running in the background and both my iPhone and the app itself are at their current updated version. I have tagged them in issues on Instagram stories, I have messaged directly and then managed to send a ticket through the app all with no response. I understand if this was a user-wide issue due to the app being new but it is not. I would have better to say because I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the beginning but can no longer enjoy because I can no longer engage. A fix is needed.",2,08-07-2023 18:22
App Store,"The poor performance of the service was the worst part of it overall. Takes way too long for anything to load including just text which is crazy to me given Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and really any other service is generally quick even with content that is media rich. The other problem is the feed is boring. I see plenty of things that are utterly uninteresting to me despite the likely importing of my interests and data from instagram. I would have expected that that would having me seeing things that were at least semi relevant to me but that is not the case. The thing I like about twitter is the ability to curate what I want to see but the approach here seems to be that the user is not in control of what they see or don’t see. All that said if this all was improved I could see myself liking Threads but for now it’s not that great",2,10-07-2023 16:52
App Store,"App that was definitely just dropped because people were fussing about twitter again and don’t get me wrong because I’d love to see new competition so twitter will step up and stop making dumb decisions, but as of now, why would I have any reason to use threads? Profiles are boring and messy, no customization besides changing your icon and putting a link, no pinned posts or some sort of media tab, no way to browse people you ACTUALLY follow, and what was the point of flexing no ads if the following feed is brand after brand after brand anyways?   There’s also no dms. 
Uninstalled after muting over a hundreds accounts, random celebrities and tiktok stars and brands I’ve never even heard of just keep appearing. Not worth your time, just keep using instagram because really, what’s the point of this app with how empty it is? Maybe in the future they will add dms and options to pin posts or have a media tab, but I legitimately can’t believe people were hyping up what’s half of a finished app",1,10-07-2023 18:11
App Store,"This app is super smooth. I love everything about it. Would be dope to be able to DM friends on here. The day that happens, Threads will most likely become my 1st app choice. There's a few bugs I hope they crank out, but overall smooth. I would prefer seeing post of people I follow vs seeing a bunch of random checkmark folks & businesses I don't even follow talk nonsense. I'm trying to see what my friends are Threading, not a verified wendys account. 

The only other issue I have is the app keeps force quitting when I try to thread. I try to log out and even reset the app. I've updated the app & updated my iPhone, yet it keeps booting me out the app every single time I try to post a thread. Its super annoying. Makes me not want to open the app and thread when I inspiration to post something. Kills the motivation.",4,08-07-2023 13:02
App Store,"Please don’t fumble this app. I’m not trying to see a bunch of random people w/ check marks on my timeline. Let me choose who and what I want to see. I don’t want to see ads and bots everywhere like on Facebook & Instagram 🙄. I’d like to see more UI changes, everything seems small. Not compressed but the font & profile pics, names and three dots to mute/block/report is kinda on the small side and very easy to misclick. Is there an algorithm? Will there be “based on what you like”? Will we be able to switch accounts like on Instagram just by double tapping the profile tab? Will we get a following tab, so we don’t have to weed through random threads? Will we be able to have muted & blocked accounts carry over to our Thread account? If I mute someone why am I still able to see their replies in others threads?",4,06-07-2023 7:13
App Store,"Got fed up with Twitter and decided to use Threads. I already have an account on insta so the sign-up process was smooth which is appreciated. If you’re familiar with how Twitter functions, Threads is similar and will be easy to pick up. 

Some stuff I’ve noticed that I hope will be added soon: “search engine” is nonexistent, hashtags don’t work (cuz there’s no “search engine” I’m gonna assume), and if you wanna plan out future posts you can’t. Idk if it’s due to this being an early version of the app and it not being completely finished + not wanting to be super similar to Instagram + wanting to differentiate itself from Instagram since all those features are available on that app but it would be nice to include them in Threads. Pls add these functions to Threads! Thanks in advance",4,12-07-2023 23:12

There may be a sacrifice of my anonymous data being sold to corps, but I am getting exactly what I want so I don’t care. Peace and tranquility and a sense of community is what I was attempting to find on other apps, and this is the first one. It’s a conversation! It’s not an argument. It’s not spoon feeding me videos all day as I scroll past over and over again. This is a new way for me to interact with people of my interests without being bombarded with outside influences. 

Nevertheless, there is still a great mixture of conversations you can randomly begin to be a part of that may not be of interest.

App Store,"Twitter is better, and this app is horrible. Threads deserves 1 star because it’s boring and not the same as Twitter. Also I don’t think we really needed a twitter clone. Tbh I think we have enough social media as it is LOL. Also why leave or delete twitter when you literally have the biggest following on twitter. Also, for all the people that are trying to leave Twitter because you're too soft to deal with people, grow up LOL. Every social media app has bots and annoying people. It’s literally the internet; if you don’t like it, get off. Threads literally has the same thing as Twitter that’s why threads are implementing rate limits on the app now. Also, If you are leaving Twitter because of Elon Musk, well... I would rather trust Musk than the person who can’t keep data safe and also has privacy issues on their app. At least Musk hasn’t been to court for mishandling millions of people's data. A lot of people forget about what Zuckerberg has done with our data.",1,23-07-2023 7:56
App Store,"The app is obviously in its early stages, with missing features like dms and a trending page. Still, I think the app runs very smooth, looks nice, and has great potential. I’ve already seen an increase of activity as the days go by, and I’m excited to see the app grow!

To everyone who is leaving 1 star reviews, realize that this app came out less than a week ago. You have no sense of how apps work if you think they would have all functions available at once. Of course it’s not perfect, and you shouldn't expect that from ANY new app. Especially considering a new social media platform is impossibly difficult to start up.

App Store,So basically since you are all owned by the same company I wondered since instagram robbed phhhoto’s boomerang feature and implemented it on instagram why not do kinda the same but with like the music feature that phhhoto had. The concept was basically you could add a song to your profile and whenever someone looked up your profile it would have the song you chose playing in the background meanwhile they looked at your profile and pictures. I figured it could work since instagram has a lot of licenses from known artists so I don’t know it might work and a lot of people would appreciate that including me. Anyways threads by far is a great social networking app and I’m glad I got to use it more than Twitter.,5,03-08-2023 17:04
App Store,"Briefly speaking, this app is decent overall, just needs some more updates like editing and better thread navigation stuff to be a more viable competitor to Twitter/be “Meta/Facebook/Instagram” Twitter.

Now for the data tracking rant.

To be fair, everything ends up collecting our data in some way or form and share it with everything else on the internet at some point. Though this is Meta which is one of the few social media apps that are notoriously bad for tracking data, they do not even bother trying to hide it for this app. At least with Facebook and Instagram you at least have the option to opt out (more likely give you the comfort feeling, not necessarily completely opting out) of tracking both as a pop up and in the settings (for ads mainly). This app? It tracks basically everything, and doesn’t even prompt you at all.",2,15-07-2023 0:49
App Store,"When I click a thread I can’t see any replies. Instead I get a message saying “Sorry, something went wrong. Try again.” Same thing when I click on someone’s profile. I go to their page but don’t see any of their threads or replies. It says “Content not available”. When I try to reply to a thread it shows up as a reply but it says “your thread failed to upload”. If I click the heart at the bottom I go to the Activity page. On that page no matter what I select from the menu: All, Follows, Replies, etc… each says “Sorry,something went wrong. Try again”. My wireless connection is strong. I’ve tried both with and without a VPN. I’ve deleted and re-downloaded the app a few times. Nothing helps. Always the same result with the same bugs.",4,22-07-2023 4:39

I tried to contest the ban but then the app completely froze for multiple minutes. I restarted the app and now it just says there's been an error. I even deleted and redownloaded the app and it still has the same message that I cant escape. there's literally nothing I can do. I'm just glad I made the account with a new instagram and not my personal account because if my actual instagram got banned for no reason I would be even more mad. On top of this, the app itself is like they combined all the worst parts of twitter and instagram, and left out anything good. The feed is clogged with posts accounts from accounts you don't follow, there's no post notification tab, no translate button, you can't select text, you can't search for specific posts, interface is cluttered, I could go on.",1,06-07-2023 14:06
App Store,"so far, i like threads. it’s pretty solid for now, it can be better. that being said, i do have some suggestions for the app developers to improve the app for users: 

CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!
only the ppl i follow and their activity should be in my timeline, not these other random users…put them on a separate page
the separate page should be our home page with news, pop culture events, hashtags you follow, and the random users/suggested posts here
pls give us hashtags!
search by hashtags and words, not just users 
thumbs down for threads (dislike count not shown public)
pls give us a gif library in the threads post area
a drafts/save for later tab for threads
following count put by the follower count too. why is it just one? show both or neither, pls pick one
show list of likes + the option to keep it private
saved/bookmarks tab (private)
dms/private messages on here 
voice message for threads
close friends thread list
these changes would make a lot of people (including me) use the app a whole lot more and come back to give a higher review rating. we thank you for the hard work so far. and thx for listening!🩷",4,06-07-2023 15:40
App Store,"Zuck, my boy…if we’re gonna rake in the legal trouble by “mimicking” or grabbing “inspiration” from the bird next door *wink wink* let’s go ahead and stick to what works. Please, I beg you, fix the video playback on this app. Let’s grant users the option to disable auto-play, let’s add a scrolling tool so we don’t have to sit through the whole video or (God forbid) have our fingers slip and start the video all the way from the beginning, and let’s fix that pesky/stubborn audio enable button. 

Also, let’s update the U.I. a little bit. It’s giving: bland. Let’s add some pizzazz! I enjoy seeing what threads my friends reply to, but I also wanna see what they like. 

Lastly, the search tab…have your team take some notes on what Bluey’s doing to make things interactive (i.e. “For you”, “Trending”, “News”, etc.) and move forward from there. Thanks buddy.",3,08-07-2023 7:38
App Store,"Like many people have said, I’ve been wanting something to replace twitter for a while and so far this is doing a good job at being that platform. I don’t like, however, that my feed is flooded with meme accounts already, and I don’t see what my friends are posting. I’m sure my friends are not posting much, with it being such a new app, but the millions of memes in my homepage ensures I will never see them. It would be nice to have the home feed dedicated to just who you’re following, even if there’s nothing new for a while, and have the search page be for meme accounts and such. Or maybe a “posts you may like” page or something. If I wanted to see a bunch of garbage on my feed I would go to Facebook. I guess I’m just hoping for something more personal and focused on people I actually know.",3,13-07-2023 8:33
App Store,"so yea, the app was amazing cuz its exactly the same like Twitter and its obviously benefit us cuz we don’t have to create another account for this apps cuz we can just use Instagram, just the serious major problems that everyone may faced the same things as me, the apps seriously take up too much space, like compare to Twitter the, the megabytes is too small and the programmed works really well-the lossless compression really work for twitter, and another things that i would want to pointed out is that since the storage is limit for certain peoples and deleting the apps seriously devastating them cuz their account is getting deleted at the same time, its really devastating and upsetting me, i wish that by deleting the apps don’t cause their instagram account getting deleted, but overall im really enjoying the thread apps",3,11-07-2023 16:06
App Store,"I recently tried out this app, and let me tell you, it was a total letdown. Right from the start, the user interface was a mess. I mean, seriously, what were they thinking? It was confusing and just plain ugly. It felt like they randomly threw everything together without any thought for user experience. I was left scratching my head, trying to figure out where everything was.

But that's not all. The app had serious performance issues. It was as slow as a snail on a Sunday stroll. Every tap felt like an eternity, and don't even get me started on the freezing! I'd be in the middle of doing something, and bam! The app would freeze, leaving me frustrated and annoyed.

And here's the real kicker: Threads had this crazy, over-the-top censorship going on. They didn't want anyone to say anything remotely controversial or express any dissenting opinions. Come on! We should be able to have open conversations without being muzzled. It felt like they were trying to control what we could and couldn't say, and that's just plain wrong.

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend Threads to anyone. The terrible user interface, performance issues, and heavy-handed censorship make it a complete waste of time. If you're looking for an app that values free speech and actually works well, keep on searching, my friend. Threads is definitely not the one for you.",1,10-07-2023 14:08
App Store,"This app is strangely addictive. i really like how close you are with your followers and mutuals, you really do get to choose what your feed is. if you want it to be news related, follow news accounts and regularly like the posts to make sure it’s in your algorithm and you’re all set. same goes with any other type of media you’re looking to see.

features a lot of us would like to see:
-a “follows you” indicator for your following tab so you can keep up on who is and isn’t following you back without having to check their account and list
- maybe some more account personalization. many yearn for some myspace-like customization 
-slightly less restrictions on following people and liking/replying to threads
- maybe a little bit more streamlined media player. idk if it’s just me but it’s clunky when i try to play videos and turn the sound on i end up having to reclick the video like 3 times 

those are just some ideas. other than that the app is really fun and a great alternative to twitter for those who don’t want right wing opinions being boosted over the majority of the users replies to every little thing.",4,08-08-2023 18:43
App Store,"No point in getting this app if you want to use it to keep in touch with mutuals. You will not see who you follow on your feed, even if you change the settings to see so you follow first. You only get to see for posts at most by who you follow, after that, you just get recommended accounts who are verified and only post twitter screenshots. I hate twitter so only seeing twitters negativity is really disappointing. 

Even if you’re content just seeing certain mutuals, if you accidentally refresh the app, you’ll never find whatever posts you were looking at, posted by your following, ever again. Your best bet to see all of who you follow Is to individually check all of their profiles daily. Who has time for that though? Might as well just take following people on the app off. Really disappointing for small creators. Not even upset for myself, just want to support my friends. Genuinely impossible. 

Another thing, pictures upload in  bad quality just line Instagram. 5 second videos take 5 minutes to upload. You have to click on the video and full screen it if you want to listen to it, with Instagram, don’t even have to click the video. You just turn up your volume and that’s why I love instagrams. 

Praying they fix that following feed issue or it’ll be the apps biggest downfall tbh.",1,09-07-2023 23:37
App Store,"Firstly a playback system, maybe if I double tap the right side of the screen it plays forward a few seconds and vise versa, a media only section to where we can only see videos and picture, ofc with the option of being able to pick which one we wanna see only which in fact twitter DOESNT have, and maybe also like a page that’s called stuff you like, that’s based off your follows and likes, like a for you page, but with a different name. Actually maybe it can be called THREADED I kinda like the sound of that honestly. Tho even if you didn’t add these things the app is already really good, I’m pretty you guys won’t F this up. GOOD JOB DEVELOPMENT TEAM",5,07-07-2023 13:26
App Store,"There are many things I love about this app
1. It's not a huge hive of right-wing idiots talking about how great their ideas are. This is unfortunately what Twitter has devolved into and why I left it. 
2. The layout is very user friendly and feels smooth and intuitive. 
3. Most interactions on the app result in learning something and not feeling like a complete IQ drain, which you can't say about Twitter. It feels like there is meaningful interactions, which gives the app itself purpose.

However, there are several issues that need to be worked on for this app to be truly great, and here is what they could be in my opinion:

1. Set up a better search function so that it is easier to find topics and ongoing things that you are interested. 
2. Make it easier to find people and topics that you are interested in by building on the integrated search functionality.
3. Although the ""For you"" section of the app is good, I think there needs to be a rework in what people can choose what they would like to see instead of just basing the content based off of what you like and follow already.

So to sum it up, it is good and not great so far and has a long way to go to be truly awesome.",3,20-08-2023 10:53
App Store,"So far I enjoy the simplicity of the app, which I understand most apps start off this way but I urge the developers to not start adding unnecessary features that make it feel and look like what Facebook, Instagram and Twitter has become. There are ads everywhere, there’s content I just do not care to see which causes me to miss the content of the people I actually follow. Also never Get rid of the free form writing features; tab or return button allowing us to create space between paragraphs, as well as the capability to write longer paragraphs. Simple and clean is the way to go in my opinion, I love to write and I love to read. I don’t mind a few videos or pictures here and there but I believe the main focus on threads should more text based content.",3,11-07-2023 12:09
App Store,"Two things 

1: Now that Twitter is X they have gone with a black and white themed app cover. Which is exactly the same as Threads but with an X instead of the threads logo. Which causes me to sometimes accidentally open X instead of threads. So if I had one wish it would be that the threads logo could change to maybe the background color being white and the threads logo being black. Or put Instagram colors in the threads character since it is technically an Instagram App. Anything to make it look different. 

2: Maybe I am misunderstanding how this app is intended to work but if this apps purpose is to be a more stable Twitter then it’s missing a major feature. 
That feature is when you go to search you can only find other accounts. But on Reddit, X and even Instagram when I hit search it  gives me tabs for accounts and other things including the latest feed from people who post anything with the # related to what I put in. Which is great when you are watching anything live because you can see other people talk about it. 

So if I had two wishes for this app this would be it.",4,14-08-2023 21:16
App Store,"The app in itself is ok. However, there needs to be a separate page for posts ONLY from people that I follow show up, none of that stupid algorithm recommending me some random accounts. There should be a sort of “explore” page for the algorithm to be implemented and suggest any content including from accounts I don’t follow and another page only for posts from those I follow. There should also be a mechanism to get rid of bots and spam accounts easily and quickly as I have already seen many bots under several posts. This is an issue that Twitter suffers pretty badly from and it looks like threads is going to as well.

Allow gif replies too. Also should allow replies to be hidden from followers👍🏻",4,10-07-2023 15:34

1. I can’t switch accounts easily like I can with Instagram. I operate a small business account and a creator account to boot and I have to hard log out of my personal account to switch. Please add switching functionality please!
2. GIPHY keyboard from iPhone does not work like it would on competitor apps
3. There is no chronological timeline or sort by feature. If there were buttons similar to Reddit or Twitter that lets you scroll between “new, hot, best, etc”, then it would make it fantastic to scroll through",4,06-07-2023 12:30

No hashtags, no search for anything other than usernames, poor interoperability between Meta platforms of any, immediately put limits but never posted or published expectations, good active threaders being put in timeout or banned due to being excited and active, no way to communicate with AI to explain your case of not being a script. Head of Instagram acknowledged that unintentional restrictions would be put on active users with good intentions with no way of getting ahold of the company. You see so much crap, and you have no control of your feed. When you unfollow people you will see the egregious content anyway.

3.	Dim Mode: Introduce a dark blue-themed dim mode within the application, offering an alternative visual style that is less intense than the typical night black mode.

4.	Hashtags: Incorporate support for hashtags, enabling users to add and search for specific topics or themes by utilizing relevant hashtags within the application.

App Store,"Not sure if the warm fuzzy new platform feeling will last forever (or once meta finds a way to monetize with ads), but right now Threads is super fun and has been making me enjoy social media for the first time in a while. I appreciate threads’ moderate approach to moderation - add disclaimers to fake news / fake news posters while also not outright censoring people. Elon musk lovers are mad, but they really should just be worried since this will definitely kill twitter. The UI is slick and the features work so far.

The overall layout of the time line is quite minimalistic, and reminds me of Tumblr in a way, so I eased into the format. I also wish we could change our usernames and names?

App Store,"My main problem with the layout of this app is the same as my problem with Twitter—the wayyy to unorganized, you can’t find what you’re looking for. Right now your profile has 2 tabs, a main one and a replies one. I’d love it if there were 3 tabs instead of two: 

• Chat (text posts)
• Gallery (Videos and photos)
• Social (Replies, quotes, reposts).

—

      Then you can also add search filters to find posts that fall under one of those three tabs, instead of just searching accounts. This way you can’t neatly organize the blog aspect, the social aspect, and the artistic aspect! In my opinion this would make it MUCH more user friendly. That way when I want to look at my favorite artists work, I don’t have to scroll through hours of ended conversions or reposts. If I’m looking for a topic to talk about, I don’t have to scroll through pictures to do it. It would also mean I could quote and repost other people’s stuff more without worrying about burying my own work/making my page impossible to navigate. Other than that it’s looking pretty good so far!",3,07-07-2023 12:20
App Store,"I like where this is going but a lot of things need to change before I use this consistently. Please make a section that consists only of the posts by the people I’m following! I’m tired of seeing random people on my feed, so I don’t use this app very much for that reason. Secondly, please add drafts. That one just seems like a no brainer to me. Thirdly, a trending page/trending hashtags would be great. Since you’re clearly taking a page out of Twitter’s playbook, why not add the good parts of Twitter? 

Also, this is just a thought, but I would really love a section similar to Facebook Groups on Twitter. Spaces where fandoms can interact just within their enclosed group.

App Store,"I can honestly say that the app is a nightmare. As an avid user who relies on platforms like this for news, updates, and connections, I am utterly disappointed.

The app's performance has hit an all-time low. It lags, freezes, and crashes constantly, making it nearly impossible to have a smooth browsing experience. It's as if the developers took a promising app and intentionally wrecked it.

And don't even get me started on the algorithm! The prioritization of irrelevant and repetitive content is mind-numbing. I followed accounts for a reason, but they are rarely shown, while suggestions that I have no interest in flood my feed. It's an infuriating waste of time.

The app also bombards users with endless ads and sponsored content, effectively killing the authenticity and charm of the platform. This invasive approach feels greedy and reflects a lack of respect for users' time and attention.

In conclusion, the app has become a breeding ground for frustration. Its glitches, algorithmic failures, lack of action against harassment, excessive ads, and poor UX have turned a once-promising platform into a colossal disappointment.

App Store,"i downloaded threads to see what the hype was about. after scrolling through the feed for a few minutes, i decided i didn’t like it. the format of the app wasn’t very aesthetically pleasing. so, i tried to deactivate my account since i didn’t want it anymore. i clicked deactivate, several times, and it never would deactivate. so, i just decided to delete the app and forget about it. except… all of my notifications started coming through my instagram app?? AND my threads number was still in my profile. i clicked “hide” multiple times, but every single time i refresh my profile, it pops up again. the number on my profile is actually ugly and killing the aesthetics of my profile. it’s so big and in your face. no one cares what your thread number is. please let me delete my account.",1,13-07-2023 18:30
App Store,"Threads suns smoothly, is simple, and really easy to use. Best of all, it’s not bogged down with bad algorithms that bury the content I want under ads and promoted content! Let’s hope meta keeps it that way. 

So far this has been, for me, more enjoyable to use than instagram. I’ve never used twitter so I can’t say, but there’s gotta be a reason I’ve never bothered. 

Please don’t mess this up, Mark, don’t ruin this for us. Keep it pure. Keep it for the people, not the investors. Let the other ad-laden social media apps carry this one financially. We desperately need a USEFUL social media app, and this has the potential to do it!",5,08-07-2023 19:17
App Store,"You should let us change the color of the icons and the letters and signs on the app, like our profile area, home, search, like, post, everywhere. One thing should be the Icon and the other should be the app, and also make different colors for everything so it can be more fun. And interesting. Also when is light mode make the options of colors different then dark mode, because if it is very bright strong yellow or any other color it will make you want to change it all the time, witch you don’t want to change it all the time",5,09-08-2023 14:41
App Store,"I kept on hearing about this app, so I finally gave it a try. I’m not sure what it is, but something about it feels fake, as in too nice, too forced, too polite, too many rules. I like the raw style of Twitter much better, you’re free to express yourself without so many restrictions. I also don’t see much action going on, maybe because the app is too new. Personally, I don’t see a point to use it when I already have Twitter and Instagram. I can see how it can appeal to some people, because you get more of the fake celebrities on here than you do on Twitter, which are usually the most popular, but to each their own. I’ll be deleting the app, since I hear that if I close the account, I also lose my Instagram account, which I’ve had for years. What a terrible decision to link both apps that way.",1,21-07-2023 3:56
App Store,"I’m not that impressed with it or the format.  It just reminds me too much of Twitter, which is a toilet bowl of toxicity.  This is heading in that direction already.  They need to create something that’s all good and doesn’t just feed the verified influencers.  It allows everyone to be verified.  It treats everyone equally.  It doesn’t shadow ban, but it also doesn’t shows you threads of people you don’t even follow nor are interested in, which is what it does now.  Someone like a Jennifer Aniston merely posts a hand wave and 400,000 people click like.  (Rolling eyes here).  How about you create an app that actually shows really great content.  People with something of depth and substance to say.  We don’t need another Twitter sound bite app.  As I said I wasn’t impressed with this.",2,09-07-2023 2:14
App Store,"Dropping another star because my news feed is 95% influencers and crap I don’t follow on ANY platform, but for some reason you guys pushed the app out before you could get your algorithms decent. Spent the last 15 minutes muting every other account because  ya’ll can’t just give us what we want. Please make the first update to have our feed people we follow ONLY. 

Dropping a star because my Thread's feed is ALREADY filled celebrities, influencers and other pages I have no interest in and don’t follow. Please, PLEASE keep the feed to who we follow in chronological order. 

So far I like it, but I’d like to be able to hide accounts I don’t want in my feed other than by blocking or restricting. They didn’t do anything wrong, I just don’t care about them.",2,08-07-2023 13:59
App Store,"Posted a video screen recording of the new following timeline to comment on the lack of content that should have been there - but then deleted it because it felt premature to complain. About ten minutes later I’m notified Threads removed it (via a time machine apparently) for sexual content. The content that was literally just their platform. So I got curious and went back and found the original very clearly not sexual content that would have been the only POSSIBLE thing they decided to keep down on appeal - and apparently not a problem. So I guess screen recordings OF threads is now sexual content? I get people can’t do all this manually, but it’s actually incredible how badly they handle these automated systems and how poorly they handle when they get it wrong.",1,25-07-2023 17:11
App Store,"Ok so, i have been using threads for about 2 hours. I have found some good, but also some bad. I love how easy it is to use the app, I love the simplicity, and how easy it was to sign in, just directly using your Instagram account. However, if you’re like me, and you want to use a separate account for Threads, then you won’t love the first implementation of the app. You are stuck using your name and profile picture that you used for Instagram and the app seems to crash quite often and I would also love some features like DMs and a couple other things. I am super excited to use this app and see how it compares to Twitter!",4,06-07-2023 2:57
App Store,"Great solution to twitter, fun to scroll through people’s thoughts and news but it’s a new app and you can tell it’s missing features. I think with time it’ll be a fantastic app if it stays afloat. One thing I’d like to suggest is separate tabs to view threads from just people your following and a tab for explore/discovery/for you, also and edit feature would be useful instead of deleting posts if you misspell and one more quality of life feature would be double tapping posts to like it would tie it into instagram nicely. Overall I think it’s a great app and look forward to seeing how it evolves in the future🪡",4,06-07-2023 21:26
App Store,"The app is decent a lot of the time so far but for it to be great i think it should distance itself a little bit from instagram, still have the option to link it with insta but not rely on it entirely. 
I really think there needs to be more user experience to it like asap, dm’s seeing your own likes, allowing people to follow without needing to accept a request when you have a public profile, SAVING POSTS‼️‼️etc I really want all these things to be added/fixed like yesterday haha- oh also make it easier for people who follow a lot of people at once to not be assumed as a spam bot please :) cant log into my account anymore bc of that",3,09-07-2023 0:28
App Store,"At first glance this app seems like an amazing mobile application. I’ve always enjoyed Instagram and I’ve always enjoyed Twitter. However, once you install this app, you will realize that you can never delete your threads account. Unless you delete your Instagram account also. For some reason, Zuckerberg and the Instagram meta-team think it’s a good idea to grab all of your health data, political, affiliations, religious beliefs, and even your credit score. Now on top of that, if you install this app due to all of the data mining that it is stealing behind the scenes, this app will drain your battery faster than any app that I’ve ever seen. So a reminder, this app is like hotel, California you can thread in anytime you like, but you can never leave.",1,14-07-2023 18:31
App Store,"The app is nice. I like the replacement twitter. Its good for old twitter users and for those who never have to ever experience that app and its users which is amazing in so many more ways than one. I wonder why this feature was not added onto Instagram instead than a separate app though? Many of Instagram’s users will probably be hearing this app around and have probably been asking for the text post feature for a while now, such as a myself. I hope to see this app do well and maybe even as an addition to Instagram than its own separate thing. I would do anything for text posts on Instagram.",4,06-07-2023 6:01
App Store,"I know there are tons of updates coming but Twitter will show the ANNOYING “refresh feed” icon under the front camera, which when pressed sends you to the VERY TOP of your feed. Threads has the same. thing. 

Twitter at least allows you to close the app from your Home Screen, re open Twitter, and the icon is gone BUT you remain at the same place where you were previously scrolling. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE allow users to do this on BOTH Instagram and Threads. I see a post I’m about to repost, like, or reply to, and then my feed refreshes where I lose the post forever. It makes me not want to use the Threads app!!",4,07-07-2023 18:14
App Store,"I made a parody account on Thread and within a couple hours it was suspended even though it clearly (in bio and user name) was not the person it was parody of.  Their “appeals” process only allowed for me to confirm a password and phone number. You cannot actually appeal, or fix whatever they determined was a violation in the first place. One I submitted my “appeal” (only phone number and password) within seconds they somehow were able to determine the ban was worthy of being permanent. Another gem of an app from the Zuckerberg farm. Further they’ll appeal all your accounts associated w your phone number (across meta/Facebook, Instagram, etc too) even if those did not violate any rules. Do not trust them with your data and use at your own risk!",1,09-07-2023 5:35
App Store,"Overall I think the app is pretty good for it being just released but as of now the only thing i can think  of that would make it a lot better for me personally is a section for threads you don’t want to post yet or just want to keep to yourself— essentially drafts. There have been many threads i have wanted to draft just to keep them for myself but can’t because the app simply doesn’t have that feature as of now, but i hope that as the app develops and updates more that we will have it in the future along with many other things",4,16-07-2023 11:10
App Store,"This app was made simply to compete with Elon Musk’s “X” or Twitter platform, which is great. Competition is necessary for businesses to get better. However it lacks purpose and offers nothing new or even on the same level as Twitter features, while also attempting to find a place in a very established way of communicating on the internet. It brings Twitter back to its basic form which it has long surpassed and expects to compete with a further evolving community. If any major company were to create a Facebook clone to compete for example, without a doubt it would receive large numbers and an influx of initial users but aside from the newly sprung app loyalists, they will always return to the established platform that they and everyone else has always been using.",1,26-07-2023 7:30
App Store,"Right now all I can rate this app is 3 stars. It’s generally pretty good, the layout is great and it feels much less toxic than what it’s trying to replace which is always a plus. Unfortunately, there’s some issues that I can’t get past without docking points. There’s no direct messaging feature, that coupled with the need of an instagram account to use the app means that this is not a standalone app but more of an addition to Instagram. Also, the algorithm isn’t the best. It’s difficult to curate your feed to stuff you want to see, like specific topics, which is something some users are already leaving over. All in all, still better than Twitter.",3,18-07-2023 11:35
App Store,"Threads in its current iteration is a random collection of unsorted and unsortable conversations among people I don't know and mostly don't care to know. Why do I follow people or have followers? I cannot actually follow anyone unless I navigate (tediously) to their profile page and scroll down at threads they created or re-threaded. That is just too cumbersome to provide an enjoyable experience. For example, I welcomed a dozen or so folks that cover my favorite college teams. But, now that Threads has scale, I rarely ever see their posts, excuse me, threads. Oh, I can still find their comments - - - over on Twitter in my Sports List. Threads is like I am at a cocktail party, incognito, overhearing conversations and feeling like I just want to leave.",2,23-07-2023 21:39

Same with the other app. I follow people I want to see. I don’t need to see ONLY influencers. I don’t mind a few sprinkled in (I do enjoy their content), but it’s all that I see. I have real friends I follow on there and they are nowhere to be found. I deleted Twitter long ago, so I probably should’ve realized it would be the same to me. It’s just annoying seeing all the same influencers sharing their same content on every app. I miss seeing people I want to interact with. Most of them don’t even interact with us peasants…",3,19-07-2023 3:18

Keep getting “Something went wrong, try again” error or “Content not available”. Tried all solutions but none worked, so I had to delete the app. Hopefully a future release will fix this problem because I really want to use it.

I also was bothered that upon installation, many of my Instagram followers “requested” a follow (which is an automatic thing upon install?). It would be nice to differentiate who actually clicked a follow button, and who did the automatic follow request.",2,18-07-2023 7:38
App Store,"The app first appeared to be a well structured version of Twitter and I had high hopes for this app, until the moment I reached the home page. The main home page is filled with nothing but posts from people I don’t even follow. I understand these big companies need to make money and paid posts are a thing as much as we hate them. But the thing that’s most annoying is that we thought this would be an app for us IRL friends to connect with one another by allowing us to choose not to follow celebrities or big companies but yet we can’t get away from them and my friends posts are nowhere to be seen. Feels like just another big tech app putting money before the users.",2,07-07-2023 16:08

Do you want to give access to a company that is that incompetent all your personal data? Scroll down to the description of what information this app collects about you. That’s not necessary to run a short posting service. It is necessary to run a business where they sell your data to other businesses.

Meta/Facebook/Instagram shouldn’t be trusted to do anything in your best interest, and they know A LOT about you.",1,07-07-2023 15:08
App Store,Good start but could be fleshed out a little more. I really hope they make it easy for you to switch between accounts like Instagram does so you don’t have to log out and log in every time. It’s also easy to switch apps from threads to Instagram but not visa-versa. Threads has an Instagram logo top right to switch easily but to switch from Instagram to threads there is no such shortcut.

Oh, I know. Because the name of the game is maximum attention. It’s only a matter of time before the ads are interleaved between the celebrity trash talk. Then the only step left is to optimize the algorithm to maximize fear and anxiety to increase stickiness.

App Store,"Threads is an interesting app with potential. It's sad how we can't add back the Threads badge to Instagram after removing it. We're also still missing basic features, such as the (1) tab to view only threads from those we follow, (2) ability to search up topics or we're interested in, and (3) privacy functions to hide those we follow and/or those that follow us. Other social media apps have these basic features! It'd be interesting to see more forum-like aspects incorporated on it. After all, forums and other discussion boards have Threads! I'm hoping topics will be organized and clearly presented (or easily found)..",3,14-07-2023 17:50
App Store,"Instagram clearly seems to be taking a shot at twitter here and i havent read one review that didnt mention how someone hated twitter or twitter was garbage now. 

so honest review WITHOUT BIAS;

this is a fad and is going to fizzle out rather quickly, there is nothing special or unique about this app and it essentially seems to be just an extention of instagram with a much worse algorithm. The feed is not really tailored to you so much as its just whats popular. It connects fully with the meta ecosystem which causes privacy concerns for me; (id also like my accounts to be separate but connected for once). it seems like they released a beta version or something because this cant be a finished product",2,07-07-2023 16:34
App Store,"Threads is the single greatest waste of time I ever came across. 98% of my feed filled with posts from users I don't even follow. People I follow aren't engaging with those posts either. Just feels like spam. I have spent more time reporting posts like this as spam, bc they're clogging up my feed. IG is already an established distraction where we are trying to keep up w our friend's businesses and shenanigans. Threads feels like a desperate outlet for incredibly bored people. Otherwise, is it just another app collecting user activity to feed a server with data?

please add a setting to limit people's posts that are just trying to go viral, excluding certain keywords (like""Elon"" 🙄) and maybe you won't lose some users",2,06-07-2023 20:54
App Store,"so i love the idea of threads. it’s a cool form of self expression especially since twitter became a ghost town (no one uses it anymore). but some things are already annoying me. firstly, having random verified people on my feed and i don’t care about them. i think we should have an option to see public thoughts and separate our followers. kinda like how ig has a favorite section on posting. secondly, i think it would be so cool if threads were built into the actual instagram app. similar to reels, we could also make threads a part of our profile. it could be a separate section like reels have that people can see our thoughts and get to know how we think. i think having a separate app is kinda extra. i love it but not a lot of people are actually interested in downloading another app, where as on the actual ig, like the new notes feature, people would engage more. other than that, i love this new addition!",4,06-07-2023 3:10

App Store,"This app is great - very user friendly, simple, fun to use and post things. Personally, I think it should incorporate more things from instagram 1) so it can further distinguish itself from that *one* social media platform
and
2) it can be a more complex, yet, again, simple to understand interface
Some things I’m talking about is maybe a “drafts” option, maybe another version of “close friends” where only a select few can view your post. Just things like that, but overall, amazing app!",4,07-07-2023 6:51

I wanted to see what people were saying about a particular news story, so I hit the search icon and typed in the surname of the person in the news. All I got was a bunch of Threads users I could follow — no search of posts. There’s seemingly no way to do that. Since I used Twitter mainly for news and now need to rebuild my feed (can’t access my old Following list anymore), this app is unfortunately pretty useless to me without a search that will help me find the content I’m looking for. Oh well, maybe in the future.",3,27-07-2023 14:11
App Store,"I love that it connects to your instagram. The app works amazing for being new. Zero errors. That’s great. However, I want to bring up the bad more than the good. Things I don’t like is seeing people I follow respond to other threads. That should be a feature one can turn off.  I just want a clean timeline of threads I follow.

Nothing works, it just keeps kicking me out everytime I try to post something. Could be something I'm only experiencing, and it's not that big of a deal because I don't post much anyways.

If this is the policy then I’m afraid the site will quickly become just as toxic as the others. Such a shame as it has such potential. I wish them all the best but if there is no rule against hate speech, nudity or scams, it’s not something I want to be a part of.",2,10-07-2023 1:59

There’s no TAGS. You can look up specific users and that’s it. No way of finding other people, it’s just whatever the algorithm feeds you- which will be mostly blue checks trying to get in your good graces so you buy their crap or whatever.

They treat all artists like their UNPAID content creators and even if you are just starting out and have a small following they limit your reach of your posts don’t perform to their standards.

Pros: Signup was a snap since it directly took my information from Facebook and Instagram. 

Cons: There are obvious missing features that Twitter has:
1 There is no institutional integration with other sites to direct users to Thread feed
2 No direct messaging 
3 No way to organize Thread followings to given topics (e.g. sports Threads in a feed)
4. The feed puts topics that would not appeal to me. Why didn’t include this knowledge from FB/IG?
5. No integration with FB/IG
6. No way to remove suggested Threads from feeds. 
7. No way to taylor ads to my desires
8. Nothing new or innovative compared to Twitter, Parler, et al.
9. None of my Followers on FB/IG directly transferred to Threads.

This questionable data handling practice raises serious privacy concerns and leaves users in the dark about how their personal information is being used.

App Store,"Good app so far!! I don’t use Twitter but since I’m joining this app right as it’s getting started I have time to figure this system out! It’s very clean and simple, which I enjoy. 

Please Meta, please add the switch accounts button so we don’t have to log out between accounts. It would be so much better!! Another feature that would be nice is filtered feed like in Instagram where you can switch between following and recommended. Thanks!",5,12-07-2023 17:44
App Store,I like this app a lot. There’s no stupid rules and toxic people like Twitter. The only thing I would like changed is when you are scrolling on your feed and you’re seeing people’s posts it would be nice to see posts from people you follow. I don’t mind seeing posts from people I don’t follow but I’d like to see majority of the posts on my feed from people I follow. I was recently scrolling on my Threads feed and 90% of the posts were from people I do not follow. I would like to see posts from people I follow. Other than that the app is great.,4,11-07-2023 22:27
App Store,"Threads is a really aesthetically pleasing alternative to twitter although it does need to have a messaging feature and also a pinned thread feature. As well as a feature that allows us to see the image posts that a user has created to help promote artists, photographers, and cosplayers or any kind of content creator really.
I love the interface, it's very cute. Also the fact I can open this app in public without the risk of seeing weird fetish porn or cats being microwaved(stuff you'd see on twitter) is very refreshing.",4,06-07-2023 17:31
App Store,"After using threads for a week or two, my account suddenly stopped working.   It is still public.  Others can see it.  I cannot post but I also cannot take down posts.  I cannot deactivate my account.  It’s just frozen in time.  

I’ve wondered if perhaps threads thinks I’m abroad, because I did travel.  But I am back home in NY and was here when this started.   

It’s much more frustrating than if the account had been entirely shut down, because I keep getting notifications that people have written or replies or followed etc, but when I click on the app I cannot see them.  And I cannot post anything to explain it to people.",1,16-07-2023 13:47
App Store,"Threads is so refreshing, it’s what Twitter used to be, Thank God. I see lots of positive posts and it’s so nice not having Elon on there pushing conspiracy theories. That feels refreshing and I hope it stays this way Facebook Facebook started as a great social community and meta-ruined it pushing you into negative conversations. I’m hoping threads stays away from that and is a more positive environment to communicate in but I won’t hold my breath. Hopefully they figure a way to keep out the bots and fake accounts.",5,14-07-2023 5:12
App Store,"It’s only day 3 and I’m already exhausted from scrolling through a feed of random verified accounts that I’ve never shown interest in or interacted with. I was really hoping that this app would allow me to view content and posts that I actually wanted to see, rather than copying every other social media and constantly forcing me to view videos and posts from accounts I’m not concerned with. 

If there is one thing social media needs, it’s the ability to truly see only what you follow. There are enough ads and suggested posts based on data sharing as it is. Please remove the feature that allows any and every account access to your feed",1,07-07-2023 19:33
App Store,"This app is so fun and it’s like twitter except for kids and more popular. I think threads should have a feature where you can switch between accounts instead of having to log out of the account that you are already on so you can go on a different account. You should really get this app and it’s so fun being some of the first 10,000,000 users on this app because everyone is just so lost and you can also see your favorite creators join.",5,07-07-2023 1:46
App Store,"I want the option to post multiple threads as a carousel on instagram.

For example, if I have 10 or less threads all replying to each other I want to hit one button to post all of them as pictures onto instagram without posting each one individually (I could post each message individually on Twitter if I wanted to take the time.) I think that feature would be really cool on threads and encourage more engagement.

Maybe we could increase the carousel limit on ig too?",4,24-07-2023 18:57

I DON’T WANT THE BADGE IN MY PROFILE AND I DON’T WANT A THREADS ACCOUNT ANYMORE! LET ME DELETE IT AND TAKE THE GODFORSAKEN BADGE AWAY!  I’m so irritated and never going to download another meta app again because I’m afraid it’s going to hold my Instagram hostage this way.  DON’T GET IT, NOT WORTH IT!

App Store,"I love the simplicity of the app, it’s very clean and easy to use. Having said that it is lacking some features. It would be nice to have a live video function like you already have Instagram on Threads. The ability to edit text maybe up to 30 seconds after we post, something, more customizable, profiles, and allowing us to rearrange the bottom bar. I’m sure a lot of this is coming, but somethings need to take precedence. For instance, the direct messaging feature would be fantastic.",4,11-07-2023 15:50
App Store,Needs a suggestions tab of “people you might know” if you didn’t click the follow all option in the beginning. tired of seeing random peoples posts. also wish the name option in your bio didn’t transfer over and you can put a different name on the threads app. Following tab for others? liked posts / #’s / trending searches / explore? But still make it stand out from twitter. Know that’s already on the instagram app but it’d be cool to have something different on threads to scroll through,4,08-07-2023 10:44
App Store,"This app is trying to track even MORE of my data than ever before? And the only way to make it stop is to completely delete you Instagram??? You won’t tell us WHY you need this extra data or continuous tracking EVEN AFTER the app is deleted (seems like a violation of Apples developer terms imo), nor are you making it easy for people to opt out of the app and it’s services. And the fact that the UK won’t allow this up in the App Store in their region for these very reasons are more than reason enough to not download.  If I’m completely misinformed or wrong, please do tell, otherwise you guys need to seriously change what this app does exactly",1,08-07-2023 23:02
App Store,"This is a new platform by Meta, it may seem like a Twitter ripoff, and it is. It’s a direct competitor to the famous bird app and it a nice addition to Instagram and the Meta family in general. One thing that I really like is regardless of using your instagram account for threads, you can choose to have your Threads profile public while keeping your Instagram account private. Again, this is a new platform and my thoughts on this could change for the better or worse over time.",5,06-07-2023 8:43
App Store,"It works as it's supposed to, but there is a bug or something that's slowing down the loading of one's own replies. That might be due to the influx of users, but it's still something that's a little bit annoying.

I would like to be able to have more functions like making the page larger on my iPad, and instantly having my totals add up instead of having to refresh the page, like close it out and open it up again, and refresh it that way, but these are early days I’m sure all these will be worked on in the future. As long as it destroys Twitter, I’m OK with that.",4,06-07-2023 12:19
App Store,"I'm a US resident, but I was in Europe when Threads launched. it seems to have marked me as an EU resident and it's keeping me from accessing my profile, notifications, and content Despite my Instagram account having an ad account with a US phone number and address as proof. I have three Instagram accounts (business, personal, and niche hobby) with none of the linked Thread accounts accessible. I've cleared the cache, deleted and reinstalled the app, deleted the app, restarted my phone, and then reinstalled. Nothing works. I've tried contacting IG support, but I know from past experience that they won't get back to me, so maybe a review of the app will. Believe me, I'd rather be on that than on Twitter.",1,16-07-2023 3:16
App Store,"Threads is the most “social” social media has felt in a while. There’s no fluff, just pure, unadulterated vibes! The simplicity and straightforwardness is the most exciting thing about this app. I dread the day ads and DMs are implemented, and pray that they won’t be.

Facebook to Instagram etc etc so the future is more going to be about what flavor and company you prefer not necessarily what’s “better “ I’m here for Threads all day to succeed bc I prefer instagram predominantly and my prayers have been answered for them to roll out this style of app/ social media platform, I love it, can’t wait to see how it improves.",4,07-07-2023 4:15
App Store,"Just delete the bird. One issue. If you can’t see replies it’s because you’re not using the same login as instagram. I used an account that I never logged into in instagram.

Logged into instagram with the same account I was using in threads and replies soon (but not immediately) started appearing.",5,02-08-2023 0:25
App Store,"Threads was fun for the first two weeks. After that it just became boring. It’s missing a lot of very basic features like drafts, bookmarking threads, ability to edit threads, and so much more. If they want it to be a “Twitter killer” they have to work a lot faster to add those things. It’s been two weeks and still nothing. Lame and boring. It only got so many people on the first day cause it is so easy to sign up for. Just use your Instagram login. Other than that, there is really nothing special about Threads. It’s just a Twitter clone but a very boring version of it.",3,17-07-2023 20:13
App Store,"Threads is such an elegantly simple concept executed upon so well that it’s effectively replaced Twitter in my daily app rotation. 

Twitter still has some quality of life features that Threads is missing, but the dev team at Meta has been super transparent about changes and improvements they plan to implement which stands in stark contrast to Twitter randomly breaking the app every other day. 

Bottom line, if you’re tired of twitter, consider trying Threads out",5,12-07-2023 20:20
App Store,"I really love this app, just beautiful and I'd say perfect if only it had the tags (which I'm sure you'll add), I have to report a serious problem that has recently arisen and that hasn't been resolved by reinstalling the app, I can only see the main threads, all the ones connected to it are not available, it says error, also in my profile it says an error occurred. I hope you fix it soon, great app",4,14-07-2023 2:25
App Store,Decided to try this app out since I’ve heard others talking about it saying it’s a better Twitter. Started going through the people I follow originally on Instagram to find out that once I get off the app I’m not following them anymore. I thought it was a one time glitch until I’ve tried it four times and it stills says I need to follow. Not sure when the next bug fixes will be but it’s inconvenient. The overall look is clean I can see potential in the app. Not sure if a lot of people will use this app since there is already Twitter and to have two apps that are identical is beyond me.,2,16-07-2023 3:42
App Store,"Okay, newer versions have a following feed now. This is great, as before I’d get hundreds of posts and not one from someone I actually follow.

The problem is you’d never know it unless you hit the home button on the bottom left. I didn’t realize it was there until I was reading an article that mentioned it. The amount of screen real estate this “saves” seems negligible and it really feels like it’s trying to hide the follower feed.",4,05-08-2023 8:35
App Store,"The app isn’t too bad and so far it feels like old Twitter. There are problems though. You can’t save posts, no edit function, searching for people/pages isn’t easy, and no info about what’s trending. 

I’m basically saying that I want Twitter cause honestly I still do. I’m only trying this because if anything could replace Twitter it might be Thread. Mainly because it’s the closest comp and probably the literal point of the app. 

Also why are people rooting for this? I mean that would cause Meta to have an even more disproportionate influence on social media…",3,07-07-2023 16:52
App Store,"I don't think it's right to give a review to this app at this stage, especially for those people who are saying negative things. Just a reminder, this app was developed by the former Facebook now Meta company, which is best known for connecting all of us together. I don't think they are unaware of what they are doing :) In my opinion, it's a great  'forum' for the Instagram app, which requires some updates to provide enjoyment to the audiences of this new AI century 😅",5,15-08-2023 21:46
App Store,"Liking this app so far, many aspects of it’s current state of simplicity is enjoyable compared to many of these bloated apps today- not sure if there’s intention to keep it this way. 

One thing I don’t like so much is the feed right now. I know I don’t follow many people and they aren’t posting, but there are a lot of posts I don’t want to see, a majority of them. Maybe an interest flow or something could get this right. Not sure. But currently I don’t want to see a majority of the threads on my feed",4,07-07-2023 10:58
App Store,"The app is OK and it has a lot of bugs. It is not as good is twitter at all. I’ve had so many problems since this app has came out not only that it is a copy of Twitter and a jp app that is 90% just like this app which I don’t find that is right I don’t like the fact that I have to have random feeds and stuff pop up all the time that I am not even interested in they need to have it where you can sign into more than one of your accounts. I have other accounts I would like to make one for but you can’t

App Store,"Thank you Meta for creating a great alternative to Twitter. I can already feel a safer, more enjoyable space - thank you!!!

Some issues: Easy to use, but no use of hashtags. You have to log out to sign into a different account. If you wish to delete your account, it will also delete your Instagram account. 

Overall though, Threads is solid. Easy to use. Reliable and overall content is better. People are happier on Threads vs Twitter. This is the app we have been asking for!!",4,06-07-2023 17:31
App Store,"Honestly I love the concept of this app and it seems like it's amazing for a lot of people but the problem is I cannot actually use it because every time I click the option to either post or reply, it immediately crashes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I tried shutting my phone off, and I haven't seen any available updates to fix the problem. It's a shame because I'd love to actually engage with the platform but I can't do that if it keeps crashing like this. If there's any way to fix this that I haven't tried, please let me know 🙏",2,12-07-2023 4:21
App Store,I like threads better than twitter because you can find your instagram friends on there and directly see everything. On twitter everyone has secret accounts and its not easy to find people in real life twitter account. I never got into twitter because of how confusing it is to find everyone and to find the right account that interests me. With threads everyone who im following on instagram is there & it makes me feel comfortable,5,08-07-2023 9:45
App Store,"I am extremely disappointed with the functionality of the Threads app. Despite multiple attempts, including logging out and logging back in, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling the app, I have been unable to upload new posts on my phone. It is incredibly frustrating to encounter such a basic issue that prevents me from sharing my experiences and engaging with others. In today’s fast-paced world, where seamless communication is essential, it is unacceptable for an app to fail at its core function. I sincerely hope that the developers address this problem promptly and enhance the app’s reliability and performance to ensure a smoother user experience.",1,06-07-2023 10:25
App Store,"Came over from Twitter, where I primarily used my account for semi-professional networking.

The pros:
• quite a bit of my network has followed because Threads is well put together
• making account was easy, albeit required I make a new instagram account
• more or less functions how everyone would expect

The one giant con is that there’s no following page. I’m a young person who follows (and enjoys) some of the pop culture pages on my personal account, where I follow them. I don’t want to see them on my professional account, where I’m scrolling to see what’s new in my field. Although less of an issue, the vice versa is also true. 

This feels like an easy fix that should be top of the list - give me the option to just look at the interactions of who I signed up to follow!",4,10-07-2023 10:56

If there was one thing that Threads could have, is the ability to switch accounts like you can on Instagram.

But don’t worry. I’m getting threads suggested feeds. Which has not been the biggest hit. Again, wouldn’t be a big deal if I could better curate my list. Right now, I’m annoyed.",3,06-07-2023 15:38
App Store,"I love Threads and its so refreshing compared to the ever-toxic Twitter but I’ve no idea how threads can persist and actually compete with Twitter without a desktop app (or at least a website) and a proper iPad app. It’s not hard to make a universal app at this point and I’m not sure what Meta’s excuse is but it is definitely an excuse. Focus on your users for once and do these things right and you’ll last.

If you loved the abuse Meta foisted of you with Facebook and Instagram through the pushing of the most inflammatory content solely to raise engagement and their emotionally manipulative advertising all the while tracking you like a parolee with a GPS ankle bracelet you’ll love Treads.

3. The ability to view the list of people you follow and ability to unfollow from the list.

4. The ability to view things you liked and favorited as a feed in your profile page.

These are major things that all other social networks have and Threads doesn’t have and for a lot of people that’s a deal breaker.

Literally all of the data collected on you personal devices which also includes browsing history, apps used, time spent on those apps, ethnicity, religion, political party, and so much more.

These “suggested posts” take over the feed and you can’t see what/who you want to see.  I finally found the setting on IG to pause this for 30 days and I saw so many posts I missed for who I actually follow.   

Make it a setting; make it like IG, or heck make it like Twitter where there’s a tab to see just who you follow. 

As it is now, I don’t think this app is for me with all the garbage forced into my feed",2,11-07-2023 14:15
App Store,I really wish the feed would allow for me to see all posts from the ones I follow only instead of just seemingly random users… this should be an absolute priority or I feel this app is going to loose users fast. It’s not needed for me to see all random people in my feed… match what u have on insta already and this would be the bomb. Also I should be able to see what’s trending… in a way. Just to know in general what’s going on on the platform!!!!,3,21-07-2023 17:18
App Store,"Clearly the app’s audience is not focused on writing, as on art, design and photography as means of expression. It should be added that by its very technological structure, the priority of the conversations or threads is given to influencers, in some cases “hot babes” of which you usually can't say anything other than ""hot"" ""love you"" ""you are amazing"" or something like that (or at least the normal people). Some media (magazines, newspapers) may offer more topics of conversation, but it is still not clear what people who are not as focused on writing as they are on visuals might have to say about it.",2,06-07-2023 17:16

App Store,"So disappointed but not surprised. Spent my first 2 weeks on Threads muting irrelevant influencers, celebrities, and companies. I just want to see authentic content from the people I actually follow. Not random “verified” accounts. Threads had so much potential to be better than Twitter but Meta is too busy manipulating the algorithm as usual. Just deleted the Threads app from my phone, so tired of wasting time on these apps anyways.
Update: after a month, redownloaded Threads to see if it got any better. None of my friends/followers are active, so basically there’s nobody except social media managers of verified accounts to engage with.😒👎🏼",1,17-08-2023 23:06
App Store,"The app works great and looks good.

However,

I like to group accounts I follow so I can see only a few of them at a time.

For example:  if I was following a slew of newspapers and other media, I might have a group called “media.”  If I wanted to check up in what was happening in science lately, I would have a list named “science” which contained the accounts which posted mostly scientific discoveries and research.

I cannot stress how useful this grouping, filing or classification tool would be.  Without it, the information I receive is just jumbled and without order. 

To be truly useful, information received must be ordered and stored and if Threads strives for true utility the ability to function as an encyclopedia is truly necessary.",4,12-07-2023 4:36
App Store,"I think the thing that formerly put twitter at the top was the trending topics, as it really showcased what people were talking about on a large scale and was a great way to stay up to date on current events and news.

Image posts should be able to share to both places simultaneously and interconnect much more. Don’t fumble this opportunity to topple the Muskrat.",3,01-08-2023 3:21
App Store,"as of right now, threads has a good foundation and has the ability to grow and expand! obviously there’s room for improvement and many key features that people want are missing, it’s clear that future updates will come through and hopefully make threads a great, polished social media app. 

personally, i’d love to see the inclusion of a ‘people you follow’ timeline, bookmarks, the ability to see quotes on a thread, messaging and group chats, and more personalization on profiles such as location and a header. i think that with those additions (and others of course), people will begin to prefer what threads will have to offer and make the switch!

App Store,I got to enjoy the app for maybe 2 hours before it decided that it was going to crash whenever I try to reply to a thread or post my own.

When I remove the badge it says “once you remove you can’t add again” I hit remove and refresh and it’s added again.

Yet I still see all of the same original accounts in my feed, as well as others I was never following in the first place on Instagram (and no, the latter aren’t even showing up because someone I follow replied on their thread).

Also from many reviews it seems really annoying that you can't delete your threads or unlink it from your Instagram unless you delete your Instagram as well.

Stop tracking at least half the data and add the option to freely unlink and link threads and Instagram accounts at any time without limits and I'll join",1,27-07-2023 17:08

Finally I deleted the odd man- the Threads cross over post and BAM, my posts popped back up. You’re welcome for that FREE information.

The problem with this: 
• the home feed is all just celebrities, influencers, and others I don’t really care about. Let me have a clear and clean home and let me decide who I want to add to the feed.

• the culture already feels wonky. Maybe it will change later, but I started to see the ugliness already come out in people. I’m sooooo over toxic spaces and I just don’t want to be in a place where anyone with an issue can project their anger at me and others.

• way too much data permissions. They basically ask permission for everything except your DNA. Also, if you want to remove that thread symbol from your IG, you’re told “if you do this you’ll NEVER get it back?” It feels so dramatic and hostile.

I even deleted the app and reinstalled it) All my friends have it so I would like to use it but freaking META is making impossible. Do not download this unless you want to be flipping annoyed.

Hopefully the algo keeps it that way! 🙂",5,06-07-2023 1:34

App Store,"Ok so I’m liking what I’m seeing for a first version of this app. I definitely think it has the potential to be a serious Twitter competitor. But it’s really barebones. 

It’s missing hashtags, a trending page, and search. These things are like the essentials for a discussion app lol. It’s ok because the app is still new, but these features should come out ASAP.

Some other features we could use are bookmarks, and a way to see past likes. We should be able to have more control over who appears on our feed. Plus some UI improvements, but that will come with time.

If y’all can get these features out I think it’ll be an awesome competitor to Twitter. We’re rooting for you 🧵",4,07-07-2023 11:37

Everything about the app and network is bad. No good content. If your friend posts you miiiiiight see it if you scroll long enough.

It is literally a copy of Twitter except they’ll ban you for saying the wrong thing! Don’t bring up Hunter Bidens laptop because that’s an untouchable subject. Don’t you dare question the efficacy of a mandatory experimental vaccine because that’s bigoted! The FBI or CIA doing more illegal activities to their own citizens?

 - Feed to capture posts of only those you follow, with option to have separate recommendations feed (which I don’t want)
- Automatic translation for all posts or button/link to translate any post (because most of my interests are overseas like Japan) 
- Ability to create lists of accounts you don’t follow but are interested in their occasional posts (for example: news, health, lifestyle, etc) 
- Edit button 
- Trends feeds
- Ability to switch locations (because of interests, and therefore see different trends in different countries)

App Store,"*edit*
Would be better if we could view our likes. 
It doesn’t have to be made public, but viewing the posts we liked would be great. Otherwise, what’s the point of liking posts if we can’t view them? 

Also, it needs a bug fix. Every time I try to undo a repost, I always get sent back to the top of my profile and it’s annoying. 

Would also be great if we could hide our following list even if our profile is public (similar to TikTok).

*additional suggestion*
I believe changing the color of the threads logo on the Instagram profile would be beneficial. A lot of people who are unfamiliar with Threads don’t notice the logo. The location and logo of Threads isn’t bad, it just needs to be a bit more eye catching",2,25-07-2023 18:06

App Store,The app is exciting and new. The process to transfer over from instagram into threads is seamless and easy. Would love to have a tab that lets you see posts from only people you’re following. My thread is full of posts from people I don’t follow and have no interest in following. Very excited to see what updates this app brings in the future.,3,06-07-2023 16:23
App Store,"Great start. It’s similar to Twitter in that it’s short form posts . I hope we can search threads by topic at some point.

Instagram is LinkedIn for photos, and this app is designed to be used in the same way. There’s no NSFW content which immediately excludes SW’s and queer folk, which are part of the essential user base of twitter. Queer people are further prevented from getting involved with this app as it’s tied to your instagram and you can’t switch accounts. Finstas exist for a reason.",1,07-07-2023 3:08
App Store,I’m only giving it two stars for right now because I’m still learning about it. You know how you can connect multiple accounts on Instagram and kind of switch back-and-forth without fully signing out… Is there a way to do that with Threads? Like is there a way that I can also have Threads for my secondary/business account in the same way that we have them on Instagram?,2,06-07-2023 22:12
App Store,I’m all for an alternative to twitter but this ain’t it yet. The UI lacks the polish that Twitter has and is just kinda clunky and unfinished in general. But to be fair I understand since it like just came out and is still being developed. My biggest issue with the UI is that the front page timeline thing isn’t very personalized and I’m getting a ton of stuff from people I don’t follow. I am looking forward to seeing this improve and be better,2,06-07-2023 6:06

2. I would also like a place to see who I’m currently following on this app. So far it only shows who follows me.

3. I have multiple accounts because of my personal and art account. There needs to be an easier way to switch between accounts.

There!  The first 10 words of this review are exactly like the Threads app.  Your feed will feature all kinds of worthless and unwanted posts.  Don't want to see posts from people you don't follow?  Too bad, because that's what Threads does.  Just be glad I didn't put *all* the words in this review in a random order...

It’s kinda almost exactly like Twitter, minus most of the best features and full of Leftist Weirdo Smelly Communists that can’t stop talking about the president from three years prior.

For those of us who joined Threads to get a Twitter alternative, we may not have an interest in Instagram itself. However, the Threads app does not provide a way to create an account — only login to any existing one. That’s sort of unwelcoming and means that we would have to download Instagram to create an account, which seems like an unnecessary step.",2,07-07-2023 1:10

App Store,It requires you use you Instagram account log in. What if you don’t want to? What if you want to keep it separate? What if you want to use your Facebook name? You have no choice. Why? Does Meta think they are the MCU? Why does everything have to be connected and why can’t we choose how we want to be connected if you don’t give us a choice?,3,05-07-2023 23:40

App Store,I regret making the account. Its a less than half baked app. Launching an app this hyped and lacking as many features as it does is laughable. “We’ll get to it” isn’t acceptable to me. It has zero personality of its own other than being a busted twitter clone. It smells of being built in about a month under a crunch deadline and shipped out to the app stores to try and meet some kind of shareholders goal with the mentality of “make it better at some other point” at the forefront.,1,13-07-2023 14:16
App Store,I like it but it keeps knocking me out of the app when I'm trying to respond or post a thread 🧵I gotta try multiple times before it let's me finally post or comment.

The likes feature should be used to connect and keep track of information but right now that information is hidden to the users while fully visible to the engineers. 

I understand it needs to be different than other platforms but I think accessing “likes” on profiles is a universal feature and would not make threads more like any other platform, it would just make it more user friendly.

A few things, I hope they implement ""Save Photo/Video"" natively—also, a translation button and maybe even gifs. I don’t care for DMS. You could use the IG app for that. I still won’t use FaceBook, though ❤️",4,08-07-2023 17:48

App Store,"This app has potential to kill what was once an amazing app and community, with Twitter, but it’s desperate for some key features. I want so badly for this app to succeed. Specifically needing:

1) a cleaned up and chronological timeline. Absolutely, under no circumstances, should we be seeing stuff from 1-2 days ago as the top threads that show up. Period. 
2) ability to see solely stuff from people that you follow
3) hashtags….
4) ability to search and subscribe to hashtags and key phrases 
5) the notifications for posts from accounts are delayed anywhere between 12-24 hours. That’s literally useless, if I subscribe to someone that means I want to see it the second they post it",2,08-07-2023 3:45

Multi profile support, ability to edit threads, able to watch video in landscape etc… and at least a few unique features to set urself apart from twitter would be great !",3,08-07-2023 7:27
App Store,The app itself is great! One feature I want to see added (if it’s not there already and I’m just dumb) is a feed where you only see stuff from people you follow.

I think so thus far, though it’s missing some folks I really liked following on the other app. But what’s getting me is this: this first version is glitchy.

What a pain.  “You can’t add the badge back on one you delete it”… says the company that keeps adding it back on and all I want is for it to go away!!!! I am now infuriated.,1,13-07-2023 15:08

App Store,"I’m rather liking Threads so far. But there are some things I really want to see and some problems that need to be fixed. 

First, it seems glitchy. I’ve been doing a lot of searching to try to follow people I am following on Twitter and Mastodon. But I get error messages about too many searches.

Second, the feed needs to prioritize the people I follow, and put their unread posts first so I can see them. If you want to follow that with posts you think I might like, that’s okay. But show me posts from the people that follow first.

Hopefully this can replace Twitter for me. It does show a lot of promise.",3,08-07-2023 1:42

If you try to say something that Meta don’t like, your Threads account could be censored or banned. If banned, you can say also bye to your Instagram account.

Last thing, if you’re unable to post, like, follow and see your activity, it probably means that you’re in EU. Since this app doesn’t respect privacy rules, Meta has decided to block all EU users from using this app. And no, using a VPN doesn’t change nothing.",1,18-07-2023 23:23

App Store,"Threads has the potential to be great, and I really want to see it becomes just that. I’m not a tech bro, but I’m a chronically online user who uses platforms like Threads for leisure and work. Here are a few additions that I think would set Threads apart and totally dislodge any and all competitors:

- DM that’s connected to (same as) IG
- Stories (+ crossposting)
- Option for chronological/following-only newsfeed
- Hashtags
- Trending (or Threading 👀) topics
- Option to save/bookmark threads
- Option to edit threads
- Option to add folks to lists of favorites (this will help media folks big time)
- Ability to do keyword search",3,06-07-2023 21:31
App Store,"Super User-Friendly, Captivating and Interesting. Hate that its tethered to your Instagram so, if your Threads page gets diabled, so does your Instagram profile. but other than that, it's definitely a fun app & community... setting the bar vs twitter.",5,06-07-2023 21:19

App Store,It was fairly decent until all of a sudden it said content not available on my profile and any profile I looked at (explore and home still work). Also I can’t make any new posts etc. I thought maybe it has to do with the ban in some countries but even using a vpn doesn’t fix it.,2,19-08-2023 20:06
App Store,"The app looks clean and streamlined, but scrolling quickly turns to chaos. It’s too difficult to find posts from people you actually follow, and the lack of a chronological timeline keeps me from using it more as it functions more like a news aggregator that only needs be be checked on once or twice per day.",2,17-07-2023 22:30

So I don’t understand what this app is for it’s literally just to watch famous people post.,2,07-07-2023 10:46

App Store,"The lack of features is laughable, Zuck wanted this out of the door as soon as possible to capitalize on Twitter’s recent blunders but forgot to add core features that actually makes people want to come back to it.

App Store,Who told Zuck that having a twitter clone for those who sell their lifestyle and bodies would be interesting? Twitter is for smart people that have something to say. Instagram is for beautiful people that have something to show. I don’t want to read thoughts of pretty girls. I don’t want look at bodies or smart people. They are different markets and zones of interests. The rivalry with twitter is not going to happen Zuck. So no echo chambers and safe spaces for you lefty too ;),1,21-07-2023 21:40
App Store,"OKAY, so I’ll be the first to admit, I said some bad stuff. I told “threaditors” to off themselves for calling themselves that, then I commented under mark zuckerbergs post that I have a 6 year old slave (I don’t, I’m literally a minor) and that got me permanently banned.

App Store,Seems alright enough. Majour isaue with app crashing especially when trying to comment on a post. Subjectively though٫ the interface is a little muddy and boring٫ as if it's intentionally designed to mindlessly scroll through.

It was fun for a week and now I want the stupid numbers off my Insta account. I hate everything about threads.,1,26-08-2023 4:55
App Store,My battery life on my iPhone after installing this app has reduced a lot. Looking at all the things this apps request for permission is ridiculous also.

Please include translale button and add a feature where what is trending could be easily seen.

Meta’s Twitter alternative has the basic features of Twitter to compete. Post a thought, reply to others thoughts. But as I use the two, I can’t help but notice the things that are missing.

App Store,"Used it for a whopping 15 minutes before going back to X so go ahead and try it out, but I wouldn’t even really bother wasting your time.

Simply put, it’s a boring one-dimensional app that’s heavily moderated and all they’re really attempting to ultimately achieve is data collection to sell to their advertisers.

Unless radical changes happen to make this app unique with utility, I don’t see if being anything special, ever.

Facebook is for keeping up with the life events of your close friends and family, Snapchat to communicate, Insta to show the world our fake lives, X (Twitter) to stay in-the-now, and Threads is… bleh.

App Store,"Absolutely no privacy with this company or app. From a person’s health and fitness data to financial info and everything in between, apparently all can be utilized by the Metaverse/Threads to sell to advertisers and who knows who else. 
Plus, there is no way to opt out or choose what information we want to share with this app. Simply by “joining” threads, all privacy is gone.",1,06-07-2023 16:05

App Store,"Due to all the promo and advertising Facebook has done to promote this app, I decided to download this app yesterday night. Big mistake.

Getting onto the app, there’s literally nothing and I mean NOTHING go for it that’s new or good. It is literally a Twitter clone with stripped down features.

As for the community, once you’re actually in it you are left to ask, what community? There is none. Think about it; the majority of this app is insta users. If that doesn’t scream bad to you I don’t know what does.

But that’s not the worst part. Take one look at the data they collect or their ToS and you will faint. It’s literally a data miner.",1,07-07-2023 18:21

All the people that I already was following on instagram, received multiple back to back “follow requests” from me on instagram all over again, when I started using threads. 

Now my notifications tab is blowing up with multiple “your connection request has been accepted” notifications from Instagram!!! 

So much for “Threads, an instagram app”. Deleted my threads profile and uninstalled the app but the notification madness on instagram is still going on.",1,10-07-2023 5:12
App Store,"Pros:
1. Easy to follow the community you’ve already built on Instagram

2. Posting is pretty straightforward 

Cons:
1. No functioning hashtags so hard to find community if you’re not already on Instagram 

2. No way to see the posts of people you’re actually following in your feed so it’s a bunch of noise from accounts you probably don’t care about 

3. No trending topics

4. No way to post from the web that’s not through the app

This needs a lot of work to truly replace Twitter but the built in community aspect makes it an easy sell. I’m not sure I’ll use it beyond sign up if the cons aren’t fixed soon, though.",1,10-07-2023 1:39

The badge won’t leave my Instagram bio. I hate it.,1,06-07-2023 22:11

Okay I’ve started using it since yesterday and to be honest it was pretty cool to me it’s the say as Twitter Facebook Instagram and all. Rip Hive web app. The new app is taking over ✌🏻🩵",5,07-07-2023 23:57
App Store,"Worked fine for a few days. Now it crashes as soon as I touch the compose icon. Also, just noticed all the privacy violations. Way too many things it can see including browser history and financial information!?!",1,07-07-2023 22:06
App Store,This new platform is so much better than Twitter in so many ways!,5,07-07-2023 20:18
App Store,Musk and his crew I’m sure are flooding negative reviews for this app.   Don’t let his hurt ego and deflating wallet determine whether you will give this app a try!,5,07-07-2023 17:44
App Store,Really wish I could just see my feed not everything else.,4,06-07-2023 19:36
App Store,"I have very high hopes for this social media platform, but the mobile version, specifically for tablets/iPads, needs improved to full-screen, horizontal, like the competitor, Twitter.",3,06-07-2023 13:21
App Store,"When I open “the bird app” it loads upwards, it holds my place in my feed so I can start where I left off. This app just throws random people I don’t follow in the middle of the feed and reloads the feed so I have to scroll down until I get to a post I’ve seen. Worst way to do that. IG is the same way and I hate that too.",1,06-07-2023 17:06
App Store,I really like this app so far. Been a huge fan and avid user of IG for a long time. Looking forward for what’s to come in the future with this app!!!,5,06-07-2023 16:47
App Store,Y’all should allow sex work on threads and show who follows you or not but otherwise than that the app is really fun !,5,06-07-2023 6:08
App Store,Great interface. Love the seamless integration with Instagram. It’s the better version of Twitter we didn’t know we needed but now have,5,06-07-2023 5:35
App Store,Definitely needs some improvements but other than that I like this app it’s better than twitter,4,08-07-2023 11:44
App Store,Threads is literally changing the way we interact with everyone and it’s just better!,5,06-07-2023 4:34
App Store,When I heard about ANOTHER social media app I was like 😩 then I was like 🤔 now I’m like 😍. So far Threads feels like a breath of fresh air— hopefully it stays that way.,5,06-07-2023 3:00
App Store,"Thank god Mark just nailed it, hopefully we will have 2+ billions people in  the world using it in no time",5,06-07-2023 0:30
App Store,"When the app first launched everything worked as expected. Now I can only see the main feed. I can’t see replies, I can’t see the activity tab (heart icon), and I can’t post anything. It’s been like this for at least a month.",1,23-08-2023 7:23
App Store,"Missing a lot of basic functionality. And like meta needs another social media app… but oh well. 

Hopefully big updates coming soon",3,23-07-2023 20:37
App Store,"It has been 4 days I cannot post anymore. It says “post failed to upload”. I restarted the app, cleaned the cache , did it all, but nothing is working. I like the app but we use our social media for business and this is becoming a bit annoying. 
Can you help?",1,17-07-2023 7:07
App Store,This app is so much better than twitter! There is way less hate and a lot less chaos. The atmosphere is not toxic!!,5,12-07-2023 19:16
App Store,"I was curious to see what all the commotion was with Threads but not I see it was just a poor attempt to copy Twitter. I think we have enough social media options. This just looks lawsuit friendly. BTW, when you delete Threads, it also deletes your Instagram. Little detail !!!!!!!!",1,12-07-2023 18:24
App Store,Tell your friend to do the same! It’s Win-Win…not really but better than nothing.,5,10-07-2023 22:36
App Store,This is way better then what Twitter has become since that Idiot Elon took over,5,09-07-2023 19:20
App Store,"Would improve a lot for searching for like minded things, or creators. Or if I could search a category rather than just a person. I know this app is in its early stages, but just a thought. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️",3,08-07-2023 22:28
App Store,"I was logged out of my instagram a day after downloading this app, everytime i would open it my instagram would sign me out automatically now i cant get into my instagram account at all, there is zero to no customer support and i want my account back",1,08-07-2023 21:34
App Store,before all of this has happened i would’ve rated a perfect 10/10 but i rate this app a 0/10 because It won’t let me login for some reason.. it said to wait a few minutes and i waited a whole day and it still won’t let me login so yea i give this app a 0.,1,08-07-2023 20:03
App Store,Lots of whiners writing reviews. For day 3 it’s doing amazing and of course all your most wanted features will be added!,5,08-07-2023 19:11
App Store,"Imagine taking everything you know about Twitter and literally copying and pasting and calling it a “Twitter killer”. That’s what this app is, there’s no difference between the original and this. The amount of data you need to share with Threads is alarming and I’d recommend everyone look into it before installing it.",1,08-07-2023 17:49
App Store,Threads is my home. I can’t imagine my life without Threads. Please never remove it from the App Store.,5,08-07-2023 17:08
App Store,Stay away as it tracks 100% everything about you! How is it even pass the privacy act to be available on app store? This makes me wonder what has been happening with my insta and fb??! Consider delete them all. Tiktok is bad but this is the worst of all.,1,08-07-2023 16:05
App Store,Please as a feature to be able to direct message.,4,07-07-2023 17:00
App Store,"Have you ever wondered what twitter would be like if it was run by a suppressive socialist or fascist government? Wonder no longer. Who cares about freedom of speech when you disagree with those whose speech is being suppressed. Threads is a joke on twitter as everyone joins threads, states an unpopular opinion to gets instantly blocked or suspended so they can post a screenshot of their suspension on twitter.",1,07-07-2023 16:13
App Store,"Why can’t i upload my profile picture? 
I tried syncing with Instagram but the profile pic isn’t working",4,07-07-2023 9:57
App Store,"I haven’t been called a slur yet, or seen anything crazy, but there are a lot of annoying brands and celebrities, so maybe being called a slur isn’t so bad",4,07-07-2023 8:34
App Store,It would be great if there is updta regarding videos posted on threads. We need video play back and forth,4,06-07-2023 16:47
App Store,Would be nice if developers could add the option on dm like instagram and chats where u can add certain people in,5,07-07-2023 4:16
App Store,"Right now without the ability to mute words, search, etc. I don’t see myself using this app. My timeline is filled with content I have muted on Twitter.",3,26-07-2023 12:03
App Store,They did the right move at the right time.,5,06-07-2023 2:05
App Store,"The most boring app. Every few days, I open it and close it almost immediately. Most followers are just ported over from Instagram and with no hashtags or local content, it’s difficult to find a reason to use.

Billionaires are stupid.",1,02-08-2023 14:01
App Store,This app is really well done and I find a lot of value in it. For following news or celebrities. Threads is my new best friend.,5,29-07-2023 22:32
App Store,Please stop recommending account that I don't follow so often. Or at least make an option to know which account we wish to see. It's really bad.,3,08-07-2023 17:52
App Store,I woulda went four stars but there is someone with a copycat app. Threads is a good app. Better than Twitter in a few ways. Twitter is garbage now. Im Threading exclusively. More streamlined. Simpler.,5,15-07-2023 4:42
App Store,"This app has potential, but it has a plethora of UX issues—I have very little control over my feed, there are concerns over accessibility and performance, and a lack of transparency around data usage and privacy, just to name a few. It’s not the “Twitter killer” that it is claimed to be, at least not yet.",1,10-07-2023 1:54
App Store,All I see are random posts from people I don’t care about or want to hear from. It was kinda fun to try out a new app with little effort but I gave zero interest in random posts that have nothing to do with my interests. I can block and hide all day but that’s not what I want to do.,1,09-07-2023 23:38
App Store,Threads destroyed my ability to post on Instagram. On Twitter some say they have the same problem. I can only post Stories. No photos. Instagram will not let me remove the Threads badge now. My Instagram worked until this. It’s been a full day! Save yourself the trouble and don’t use Threads.,1,09-07-2023 20:34
App Store,You can’t delete it with out deleting Instagram account. You can’t create an account with out an Instagram account. A lot of features look the same of other apps. Plus zuck collecting data of you on all his media platforms and selling without your knowledge.,1,08-07-2023 22:23
App Store,"Great experience bc it’s new. It’s very fun but it freezes a lot. That’s my only complaint. And the people on my feed page, I would like to see the people I follow only.",3,07-07-2023 3:28
App Store,"Nice design, excited for new features",5,07-07-2023 4:29
App Store,Literally when I downloaded this app I immediately switched from Twitter to Threads in a matter of 5 secs! Loving it!!!,5,06-07-2023 18:53
App Store,I have multiple accounts and would love to have the same option as instagram to switch accounts without having to login/logout each time!,2,06-07-2023 21:23
App Store,I’m excited for this app but the MAJORITY of my feed is people I don’t follow and brands! Please stop. I don’t want those on my home page. I’m happy to check recommended content on an explore page but what’s the point of choosing who to follow if the app is going to decide what I’m going to see for me??,1,06-07-2023 16:17
App Store,"Hi! When i try to log in to my account; it doesn’t open and tell me i’m Community banned and it is limited so i should try it later. How can i open this when it’s trended right now ?! It’s Horrible interpretation of Twitter made by Mark, honestly i can’t stand it when it doesn’t open. I don’t recommend this 👎🏻",1,06-07-2023 10:32
App Store,I love the app but why can’t I have the ability to delete something I have posted?,4,29-07-2023 21:10
App Store,"How are you not going to have an option to only view posts from the people you follow? What makes you think your algorithm knows what I like better than I do? On the other hand, it’s not owned by Elon, which is a plus",2,06-07-2023 10:04
App Store,"This is definitely an early tech demo/alpha release. Lots of core functionality missing, like a web UI, native iPad layout, chronological timeline, ability to mute words, DMs, etc. I will check it out again once they get a feature-complete v1 released, but seems like it will be a bit before that happens",1,06-07-2023 1:19
App Store,"I love it, Better than others",5,06-07-2023 0:27
App Store,"I just downloaded this app and I have nothing to browse. I don’t want to see only what the people I follow post, there needs to be an explore page when you can browse things/comments to your liking.",2,05-07-2023 23:56
App Store,5 seconds in to the app…its exactly like twitter but just different looking. Functionality its the same. no ads🤷‍♂️,5,05-07-2023 23:44
App Store,"Fine app, will see how it evolves but at the moment there is no option to change the background color and it is set to a really harsh white.",3,05-07-2023 23:26
App Store,Is the exact same as twitter and if I wanted to have  twitter I woulda just made one there and can’t even delete my account cause it’ll delete my instagram too which is a huge F you from the company for trying to leave there stupid app and it’s just crazy how petty a company can be,1,11-08-2023 14:12
App Store,You can’t delete your account unless you delete your Instagram account after installing and signing up. It’s also the most invasive app in terms of privacy issues. I wish to not install it first hand,1,10-08-2023 15:40
App Store,"It’s like the bird app but without the hate speech and crypto scammers

Unfortunately any time I tag someone in a post it says “try again later”. It’s absolutely ridiculous and there is no way to contact Meta to find out why. This makes it impossible for me to use this as a replacement for Twitter",1,04-08-2023 1:40
App Store,Wish there was a way to see the threads I’ve liked! This is so frustrating that I can’t view them,4,07-07-2023 15:31
App Store,"Discovery feels nigh impossible, you have to know user names. You can’t even search for content. Can’t even save images. Not optimized for iPad. Didn’t bother going any further. Ranked in terms of egregiousness.

This is Meta, a multi billion dollar social media company. This isn’t their first rodeo, so I find these unacceptable.",1,21-07-2023 10:12
App Store,Feed is filled with things I do not follow.  I don’t think I have came across an account I follow unless I manually search for the person or account.  I don’t understand what the hype is here and I hope these issues are fixed soon to put accounts followed in chronological timeline.,1,16-07-2023 15:46
App Store,Share content with your friends. Meta actually sent a survey for me asking if they’re making trends or following trends and I have to say they’re definitely following trends they just find any app they want to replicate and replace and it’s not even a good version of Twitter.,2,14-07-2023 2:22
App Store,The Thread number badge that indicates the number of people who have joined Threads before you does not show up in my Instagram. The only this that shows up in my bio is the Treads badge with no number. Hoping this glitch can be fixed.,2,12-07-2023 23:25
App Store,I absolutely love this app and the people here are nice. I can’t wait to see what new updates bring to the app.,5,10-07-2023 0:24
App Store,This must be planned as a refuge for people who couldn’t handle free speech and still wear masks in their car. Exact copy of Twitter but with more pics and your feed filled with people you don’t know. Uninspired and and buggy. If you have Instagram this is very redundant. Basic Twitter with some Instagram painted over it.,1,09-07-2023 16:20
App Store,"Such a great app so far, still needs updates like follower feed but overall is fantastic.",5,08-07-2023 10:14
App Store,It’s nice but I don’t like seeing other people’s accounts that I don’t follow or have any relevance to the accounts I follow it makes me really mad honestly.,4,07-07-2023 4:56
App Store,"I really like it 
I just downloaded it not too long ago but i am already getting addicted to this app lol",5,07-07-2023 7:53

App Store,"i downloaded this app to see what it was all about, it’s basically the instagram version of twitter. once i decided i didn’t want to have that app, i tried to deactivate my profile. the threads number also appears on my instagram bio, which i don’t want it to. i tried to deactivate my threads profile and hide the badge on my instagram bio, but it won’t go away.",4,08-07-2023 4:42
App Store,Great app! Its like for people who don’t like twitter because of their political beliefs but all in all its chill im sure censorship will be at its worst around the next presidential race in usa.,5,06-07-2023 17:00
App Store,You know it's fresh when there ain't no reviews. This review is subject to change lol,5,06-07-2023 8:27
App Store,I really like the app so far and I think its better than twitter but the timeline is mess. No point in following people because its just filled with everyone. Needs to be a filter feature,3,06-07-2023 3:27
App Store,More simple and easy to use. Please add a hashtag feature in a future update.,5,06-08-2023 15:02

App Store,"I’m sure if you’re used to Twitter it’s good, but I really don’t like that there aren’t separate “explore” and “following” pages. I don’t like seeing posts from random accounts I don’t follow",3,23-07-2023 23:13
App Store,"I haven’t been able to post, view comments or my profile for weeks now. My feed is full of poeple I don’t even follow. Pointless app. Should have launched when all the bugs were fixed. How are you going to launch a app that does not work?",1,23-07-2023 17:01
App Store,"You have to have an instagram account to use this.  It feels like what should be a part of the instagram app, but just carved out so it can be advertised as something new and cool. It’s really just a set of basic features that should be part of instagram.",1,18-07-2023 12:31
App Store,I don’t like the new update. I liked the number in everyone’s instagram bios and I think everyone else agrees. This app is going downhill. It’s a twitter wannabe when it could have been twitter wanting to be,3,17-07-2023 9:44
App Store,Looking forward to the updates as this grows,5,10-07-2023 2:23
App Store,"What exactly does a social media app whose purpose is text chat threads need permission for “Health and Fitness data”?  This is a Facebook app after all so I can’t be surprised.

Wait till it integrates with ActivityPub which they claim to be planning to do.  Then use a Mastodon server that respects your privacy to access Threads content.",1,09-07-2023 10:20

App Store,"The app has already been filled with spam bots, algorithms and reels. If you download you can’t delete your account without deleting your IG page. The app also accessed apps it shouldn’t to gather information about you. 
There are so many cons about this app. Do your research before you download!!",1,08-07-2023 1:36

App Store,Pretty nice not constantly seeing hateful things in my feed. Lacks features and users. Expect both to grow??,4,05-08-2023 5:17
App Store,it would be a nice app if it didn’t keep logging me out my Instagram.,5,06-07-2023 7:22
App Store,Forced to follow random accounts. No customization options. No lists or separate views. No sorting. Friends aren't floated to the top. No nsfw content. Your scroll placement isn't saved. The feed refreshes whenever you click anything and then you got random posts again. It's not a good app.,1,06-07-2023 0:27

App Store,"Not a very good app. Just people self promoting and saying dumb things. They also don’t let you delete your account, and if you delete the app you can’t delete the badge from your Instagram account if you delete the Threads app so you’re basically a permanent advertisement…",1,11-07-2023 20:13

App Store,"First doesn’t open, I don’t wanna put my credit card info just cause I don’t share my info there, second, I don’t know all those people and I don’t wanna to connect with FB! Already got ride of this 16 yrs ago. Third, what’s exactly serve me? Look like stupid waste of time. Disconnect thx",1,23-07-2023 9:52
App Store,"After sharing a post from Threads to my Instagram, all of my Instagram posts disappeared and I can’t retrieve or see them anymore. I can’t post anymore either. There is no customer support. And my Instagram account is now useless…",1,13-07-2023 10:34
App Store,"i got the app because it looked fun but when you download it it's a rip off boring version of twitter, and you can't delete it without deleting your instagram account so DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you want to have an ugly badge in your bio",1,12-07-2023 21:06
App Store,i love the app so far it looks amazing. it’s just pretty annoying that i keep getting logged out. also wish it had the switch account option like instagram so that i wouldn’t have to keep logging out to go on another account. i know it’s a brand new app so i will be looking forward to the updates.,4,11-07-2023 13:59
App Store,Where translator ? That’s really useful thing,5,11-07-2023 19:40
App Store,Why are we not able to edit post. Please make that an option….,4,07-07-2023 3:56
App Store,"After downloading the app I accidentally pressed the button that says remove the threads badge, like why isn’t there an option to get the badge back ?? Or choose when we want it on or off OUR instagram profiles🤔.",1,11-07-2023 13:01
App Store,"All I see is influencers and celebrities. That’s it. That’s all you’re pushing on everyone! I rarely see a post from someone I actually follow, and they do post because I can go on their page and see the new ones, you just don’t show it. Ridiculous.",1,09-07-2023 4:31
App Store,"It’s legit twitter, but you can’t even see your own followers’ “tweets.” It pushes so many ad-based celebrity accounts to the point where I can’t see my friends. Please add a “Just Followers” tab! I do not want to be constantly fed posts by your algorithm.",2,08-07-2023 17:15
App Store,I zapped my acct with the bird months ago. Threads seems friendlier with a lot more interaction with the verified that I didn’t expect. I love it!,5,08-07-2023 8:47
App Store,So far so good! Like the way it runs and connects with my instagram account! This is going to blow twitter out of the water!,5,07-07-2023 4:55
App Store,Threads is way better than I thought you can interact with other accounts and I’m so happy a new good social app came out,4,07-07-2023 1:43
App Store,"An app itself feels like cheap twitter put into instagram skin. No support, no good features, random bans. Considering Facebook privacy policy you are giving away all your data including medical, personal, interests, shopping etc to Meta for free with no real benefits. I would rather go and use crappy Twitter.",1,07-07-2023 3:21
App Store,"this is good for a start 

they should add a drafts system though, and add a way for users not logged in to view the site",4,06-07-2023 16:57
App Store,Nice competitor but you can only save the images thumbnails. Not the high resolution one when you open the image to full screen,3,06-07-2023 15:19
App Store,"Plenty of people out here who don’t want to be on FB or IG, but ARE willing to try this app out. 

META will keep new users from joining - that’s a mistake. Guess I’m stuck on Twitter until META allows a new user to open an account.",3,06-07-2023 13:21
App Store,My Threads won’t show up on my Instagram account with the numbers,5,16-07-2023 5:25
App Store,"The point of social media is to see posts from people you follow. Why is my feed exclusively people I don’t follow? If I wanted to see their posts, I would follow them. The fact there is no option to only see posts from people you follow is mind blowing. 

Still better than Twitter.",1,06-07-2023 0:14
App Store,I find it stoopid when it doesn’t say what places people are from I end up having people from all over the world…it dose t help artists or any small business owners  …..and that’s instagram to of course,2,14-08-2023 15:07
App Store,"There is very little difference between this and Instagram.  The posts people make on Threads are exactly the same types so I’m wondering what will be unique here.  

Also, no way to edit posts???",2,04-08-2023 23:51
App Store,"I loved threads in the beginning, but I took a vacation to Europe, where Threads is apparently not available, and it seems they restricted my account so that the app is unusable. I’m back in the states but the app is not working no matter what I do. I filed multiple reports but haven’t heard back.",1,22-07-2023 14:19
App Store,This app just benefits lefty wing politicians and actors and actresses and influencers withy he algorithm. Many but many of the right wing ones that have over 60k followed on thread barely get 4 likes in their comments or posts. This is so odd. Also the app is freaking boring. I’ve heard this from both right and left.,1,17-07-2023 12:39
App Store,"Major fail if there is no way to see trends.  The appeal of Twitter is to get RT info.  Without that feature, I am not interested.   I don’t want to follow a ton of people to up my chances of see what’s happening.  

I hope to be able to edit my rating.  For now, am not going to use this app",1,16-07-2023 18:24
App Store,"But considering I just joined the 🪡 Community today, I won’t be picky. I’m glad to be here and have so far enjoyed the experience. 👍🏻",4,15-07-2023 20:06
App Store,"This app jammed so many annoying people on my home feed. Until you figure how to only see people I follow on my feed, I will not be using this dogsh#t of an app!! I only want to see people I follow on my home feed NOTHING ELSE!!!",1,12-07-2023 7:14
App Store,You can only attach a pic. You should also be able to post a gif within the app.,3,12-07-2023 6:22
App Store,"In typical fashion for this company, Threads shows you everybody that Meta wants you to see instead of who you want to see.

So now I have a timeline littered with posts from pop-culture luminaries who I neither know all that well nor care about and that noise drowns out that posts from that people I follow.",1,09-07-2023 16:21
App Store,As predicted. This app is full of censorship and it lacks freedom of speech. Now that I have signed up using my Instagram account I can’t delete my account without deleting my Instagram account therefore deleting all my pictures and comments and then the app will do for now.,1,09-07-2023 14:52
App Store,Y’all in these reviews just hating this the best thing instagram has done so far no need to complain,5,07-07-2023 20:55
App Store,You should be able to set up an account independent of Instagram. It’s obnoxious and super lame that the only way you can login is to use an Instagram account. It’s a pathetic move. I don’t care what the underlying motivation is for Meta it’s a stupid move.,1,07-07-2023 19:24
App Store,"Information overload. I see a lot of post in the feed that I don't care about, just wanna see my favorites and maybe threads that people I follow reply on. It's a great concept but just way too much information in the feed and it's hard to process.",1,07-07-2023 12:26
App Store,"Hashtags don’t work. Link I gave to Linktree had a Threads link to get back. Links open in Threads ecosystem, not Safari, and the link back to Threads FROM Linktree doesn’t work. Musicians should be able to get verified. Threads does not indicate any way to get verified. Looking forward to Threads improving upon all of this.",1,07-07-2023 5:39
App Store,I haven’t had Instagram in forever. I was hoping to check out what this app was like but I can’t even make an account once I download it. You have to log in with an Instagram account. Kinda lame. I’m not going to download Instagram just to use this.,1,07-07-2023 0:35
App Store,I like the new app which can let you write a thread which can be similar to Twitter and it looks great 👍,5,06-07-2023 5:28
App Store,"Needs a search function to find threads, and some sort of an explore tab. App feels weird, like it’s an extension of IG, so it could benefit from being more detailed/transparent",3,06-07-2023 0:24
App Store,"The only way you’d enjoy this app is being a far left extremist who when met with opposition will want to ban you, since they can’t censor their rivals now on Twitter. They use this trash app to stay wrapped in their echo chamber. Sad state of the world when a political side pushes mutilation on minors.",1,06-08-2023 11:31
App Store,"also warning; if it fails to upload, threads won’t save anything as a draft. kind of frustrating if you write long threads. 

they should definitely fix the fact that you can’t edit what you post 

other than that; this is one of the easiest apps to navigate since there’s no direct messaging as an option.",3,01-08-2023 22:47
App Store,"This app needs to be useful to be successful.
No hashtags, lame algorithmic timeline with no other choices and lots of junk content similar to Instagram.
Sorry, you are missing your chance to replace Twitter.",2,19-07-2023 7:45
App Store,Love the app but I wish we could use hashtags or find trending post other than that it has good potential,4,15-07-2023 12:43
App Store,People say it’s like Twitter but I disagree. This is more like the original Facebook. No videos just memes and text.,5,11-07-2023 9:20
App Store,An iPad version is needed. This version makes it very difficult to post messages since the keyboard often covers the post button and cannot be minimized.,2,12-07-2023 17:13
App Store,I start thread just from few days please update translation in a caption because there is so many language around glob and everyone share thread but most of the time can’t understand,2,10-07-2023 10:49
App Store,"Just take a look at the sheer amount of privacy and data you have to surrender even before using the app. And for what? A post + thread environment with no additional functions.

This app doesn’t require a fraction of the data it says it needs for use.",1,10-07-2023 19:44
App Store,"I can like but I can't comment, when I click the comments button it kicks me out of the app. Any tips?",4,07-07-2023 23:55
App Store,I love the vibes here! Definitely a better twitter. I hated the spam dms and here they are no messages!!!😊 we just need an unfollower app ASAP,5,08-07-2023 23:34
App Store,Super easy log in but It crashes every time I click the make a post button,3,08-07-2023 21:38
App Store,"If you have no concern about data privacy and want to use a crappier version of Twitter, this is the app for you. If you believe Meta has your best interest in mind you are mistaken. When you use their products, you are the product.",1,08-07-2023 18:57
App Store,"But with a clearly defined class system. As a less than of low notability, I cannot have a blue check. If that isn’t enough, I must also acquiesce to a feed with lower neural activity which is curated to ensure I think mostly happy or compliant thoughts which ensure I support The Current Thing.",1,08-07-2023 18:39
App Store,"obviously this is designed to be a - much needed - competitor to twitter as it circles the drain, but so far it is not up to speed. most of what i see on my feed is accounts i do not follow and have no interest in. this is the biggest reason i won’t be using the app until this improves. as another review said there’s no dm option or group chat option either id assume?",3,08-07-2023 16:00
App Store,The app is full of weird people and it’s just too much like Twitter. It’s owned by Meta which is becoming more and more of a monopoly. They are reaching into Twitters market space and constantly stealing ideas and doing whatever they want to do. The government needs to do something to regulate big tech.,1,08-07-2023 2:52
App Store,"The app is great, but it is lacking a key feature.

The app needs some way to only see people you follows posts",4,07-07-2023 0:27
App Store,"I do like IT, although it crashes so many times on my se2020",5,07-07-2023 21:14
App Store,Seems that it’s impossible for me to be signed in to both threads and Instagram. If I login to threads and then open the Instagram app I find that I’ve been logged out of Instagram. If I then login to Instagram and open threads I find that I’ve been logged out of threads. Please fix this!,1,07-07-2023 16:30
App Store,"It's a Twitter clone, but it's pretty good. It needs a way to only see threads from people you follow and to sort by most recent.",4,06-07-2023 6:03
App Store,It’s just started but I have hope.  Strange day I’m rooting for Meta but it’s against Musk.  So here’s my review.,5,06-07-2023 22:05
App Store,Better than having to deal with the freaking post limit on Twitter...,5,06-07-2023 20:49
App Store,"app is brand new and exciting, but leaves some MUCH desired & essential features such as:

a follow back button
2 separate following & “explore” feeds 
able to search posts, in addition to users",2,06-07-2023 20:46
App Store,I am about to download this app and am already hooked.,5,06-07-2023 17:56
App Store,Like the concept so far … looks like the biggest group,5,06-07-2023 16:35
App Store,"I was looking forward to using a new platform since I have been banned multiple accounts on Twitter (while Far-Right, MAGA, Insurrectionists get their accounts reinstated). The thing is you need to have an instagram account to create a Threads account. Definitely a non starter.",1,06-07-2023 13:44
App Store,"I am loving the new platform, but there is something essential missing for global communities - translation options!

On that other app (you know what I’m talking about), there is a built in translate feature, and i am also able to use apple’s translate feature because i can select text and choose “translate”.

This is going to be essential for quick conversions.

Thanks, loving it so far!",3,06-07-2023 11:56
App Store,Miles and miles better.,5,06-07-2023 10:36
App Store,I’ve worn out the mute button over the past four hours since I joined. Give us a fully customizable feed and you’ll get your stars. We also need a media tab on profiles and DMs.,2,06-07-2023 5:43
App Store,"So far not bad, it's easy since you can connect it with your Instagram seamlessly. Now this makes me look forward to Musk vs Zuck 🥊 even more.",4,06-07-2023 0:56
App Store,I would like to be the first to review. I can't believe we have an alternative to twitter that is actually digestible and free of hatespeech,5,06-07-2023 4:36
App Store,But honestly kinda wild and boring one cannot have a chronological timeline. For now I pass while keeping my acc just in case. Also it’d be nice if the app didn’t collect this tremendous amount of data.,3,06-07-2023 2:04
App Store,"Can we please get a real iPad version? I use an iPad mini, and the app is obviously just an iPhone app blown up. It looks lame.",4,19-08-2023 14:57
App Store,"It needs recommended content in the discover area, it’s just a search bar for people. It does not allow to search keywords or use hashtags. 

It needs a popular topics area, like the 
Trending area, it only 1 feed (similar to Instagram’s feed)

It’s not a separate app like Facebook it’s to Instagram, it’s an extension of Instagram in a separate app.

At the moment, Twitter still the better options unless you are famous with a lot of followers.",2,06-07-2023 0:51
App Store,Really?!,4,05-08-2023 3:41
App Store,I think they should allow were u can dm other people privately,4,09-07-2023 8:30
App Store,Glad this exists because Twitter is on the way out but this should not have launched until they were ready with all features.  No hashtags.  No trending topics.  No searchable topics.  No DMs.  If this is supposed to be a twitter copy but better then make it better!!!,1,20-07-2023 11:17
App Store,"So I’ve been dabbling with this app for a few days now, and have decided that it is pretty lame. It’s basically just a bad version of Twitter. If you’re a super sensitive cry baby, you might like it. I think free speech is pretty cool though, so this app is a flop for me.",2,18-07-2023 19:43
App Store,"Sure there’s potential (it can’t be that hard to make a twitter clone), but it will not be useable until it has the option for a chronological timeline with only accounts I follow. Also, no website? Pull it together.",1,18-07-2023 4:41
App Store,"i don’t want to see random people on my feed. please fix immediately, i only want to see people i follow.",4,08-07-2023 16:49

App Store,I'd love this app but while scrolling it's annoying. There's nothing I'd like. I just want the option to scroll by following. Unless I'm missing something,3,07-07-2023 4:10
App Store,"There's a lot of people using it, which is great, but it crashes when you go to post, can't update your user profile, search doesn't exist, and most importantly, there's nothing like lists.",2,07-07-2023 2:59
App Store,The app is broken rn like I can't even post anything on there yet without it crashing every time,4,06-07-2023 20:03
App Store,"(Im the first review) I never used instagram in my life only once to sign up and i dont even know my login. Im not about to download 2 apps just to use one.

App Store,"It’s pointless, to a certain degree. If you want to read about the news then Threads is for you. Pictures are included, but it still does not tell the story is visual setting. It reminds me of blank twitter. The screen is all white. There isn’t any color to draw me to the new, news.

App Store,Nobody wants to see them blue checks… the celebrities..the ai composed threads…or half naked people. We want am app truly for us people/humans. No advertising. None of it.

App Store,it's originally developed to beat twitter but it cannot take twitter users. it is a mere copy of twitter and another form of instagram. it will divide instgram users but twitter users will stay where they belongs. as Elon says free of speech is the key to the platform but Threads lacks of it.,2,14-07-2023 2:51

App Store,"If this app is gonna be better or at least equivalent to twitter it needs a few things. 

- Followed Users Timeline (this is the biggest one)
- Let us rewind videos
- Better search function, why can we ONLY search for usernames?

- DMs??? Meta has Messenger, why is there no integration or a built in DM feature?",3,11-07-2023 4:44

instagram is a fairly run, pretty good app all things considered. it has a decent moderation system (still a couple inconsistencies) and the layout is generally pretty cute.

i’m already liking the layout of this app, although i hope sometime soon they add a dm feature. i know instagram already has dms but i think it would be easier to share threads with people through dms via threads. 

great for how quickly it came out though!",5,06-07-2023 19:06

App Store,"All the posts algorithmically fed to you is boring, generic, outdated, and mind numbingly unoriginal. Feels like scrolling through LinkedIn feed. The community of users has a bland vibe.

App Store,This isn’t a standalone product. You have to make an instagram account to use it. It’s only meant to be a way to increase new accounts for IG. Services that can only be accessed via linked social media accounts are scary and should be avoided for their datamining alone.,1,08-07-2023 6:40

App Store,Just sponsored and suggested content. No way to filter to just accounts you follow. Somewhat confusing interface. All settings open the Instagram app and need to be adjusted in there. It’s basically an add on to the Instagram app. Pretty disappointing.,1,30-07-2023 14:41
App Store,"I like the app and interacting on it. It’s way better than Twitter because it’s not a toxic cesspool like Twitter and to a lesser extent Instagram.

Threads app is the Future🫶",5,08-08-2023 12:21

App Store,This app tracks everything from health and fitness to “sensitive info”… pay attention people. There’s a reason Apple implemented an ask app not to track feature. Its because of META!!!,1,29-07-2023 5:57

App Store,"It’s a copycat app that requires too many permissions. In addition, it is an anti-science app that is dangerous to the world as the very nature of science requires we ask questions. So when there’s a pandemic or some other disaster only biased information is allowed.",1,18-07-2023 22:48
App Store,Okay I would like to have this but I just don’t want to make an insta account just to get this app. And I probably sound stupid for saying this cuz I’m sure everyone else knew this but oh well lol.,1,18-07-2023 4:15
App Store,"app runs wellish. there needs to be a following only page cause i see too many random people i don’t care about, i never get notifications for the people i have them on for, the interface is so cold and dull it makes me feel like i’m in a hospital but in app form",3,16-07-2023 1:40

App Store,instagrams algorithm works better for me. on tw***** the algorithm shows me things that are harmful to my mental health. on threads i don’t have to worry about that. it’s just cute art that i like. it’s simple. i like this more. i don’t understand the complaints personally.,5,15-07-2023 22:19
App Store,Just does everything better than Twitter,5,10-07-2023 13:46
App Store,The lack of hashtags and a good way of searching for information makes this app hard to use.  I just see a bunch of memes about Twitter being dead and nothing of substance; I was not a haven instagram user so perhaps that’s why?,1,13-07-2023 1:12

App Store,"I downloaded and deleted the second it told me I needed an Instagram account to use it. I ain’t playing that game. Just like when Facebook decided you needed the messenger app to read message, I never once opened another Facebook message lol.",1,07-07-2023 23:53
App Store,I would like to see a trending page added of some kind,4,07-07-2023 2:52
App Store,I have friends and mutual whose content is buried behind Ellen and Hank Green. I don’t care what celebs and popular people have to say. IG does this with suggested posts and it’s the worst. Just show me what my friends are up to. It’s not that hard.,1,07-07-2023 12:41

App Store,I have noticed as of Friday that once I click on the icon to write a thread I get kicked out of the app 🥴.  I have to uninstall at least once per day (so that it functions properly).,2,09-07-2023 11:15
App Store,Deleted pretty quickly. Wanted to like it. My feed was filled with posts from users I didn’t want or ask to follow. The content was random and irrelevant. I wish I could have started with a blank slate and choose who I follow.,1,08-07-2023 5:29
App Store,"This app is already amazing and smooth all you need to do it listen to feedback and you’ll kick Twitter off the planet, GO THREADS #### TWITTER",5,07-07-2023 22:59

App Store,the threads community would REALLY love an inbox where we can reply to peoples threads & have conversations privately.,5,06-07-2023 22:19
App Store,Too premature and not well developed. By the time you add more features people already left and less interested.,3,01-08-2023 5:15

App Store,"Been in the app for 30 seconds, my feed is full of blue checkmarks that I don’t follow and can’t seem to unfollow. Refreshed my feed and saw an obvious scam. This app has been live for what, an hour? 

Why is it so hard to only show the people I want to follow in my feed?",1,05-07-2023 23:38
App Store,"I go to search for trending news or topics, but there really is not a way to do that. Searching for “Bogota” for news just provides a list of people with “Bogota” in their user name.",1,17-08-2023 19:23

App Store,I remember back in the day when we use to copy CD’s with CDburners and sometimes copying just failed and it didn’t work. A lot of missing features that twitter has. Also why would anyone signup for another censored social media app.,1,11-07-2023 3:15
App Store,If I hide it from my account is there a way to get it back?,4,06-07-2023 21:23
App Store,Fine for folks that live on their phone but for “the rest of us” the lack of a web interface makes it useless.,1,10-07-2023 14:38
App Store,The notifications are so delayed. Like it’ll be like ‘this person just posted now’ and it’s a post from like 3 days ago. it’s so annoying 😭,2,10-07-2023 4:30

App Store,"Sorry just gonna say it. I hate it I tried and tried but this app was worse then when twitter was owned by the previous twitter owner. At least the OG app *cough**cough* twitter shows more promise than this. And truth be told ""Threads"" came and started on twitter. Sorry dudes",1,09-07-2023 15:54
App Store,I downloaded it and imported all my stuff from IG but see literally NONE of them. All I see are ads.  I’ve blocked as many as possible until I was just tired of it.,2,08-07-2023 19:24

App Store,Much better than Twitter,5,06-07-2023 2:15
App Store,"A very bare bones. twitter clone that claims to allow you to follow individuals but doesn’t actually show you posts from those who you follow. No chronological feed just one big algorithmic pool full of brands and influencers. Completely wrongheaded thinking from jump. 
Skip it.",1,06-07-2023 1:29
App Store,"You have to be verified in order for your posts to be discoverable. From a posting standpoint, how will I find the people that enjoy what I post?

App Store,It’s like Twitter but no pics or videos and anti free speech why wouldn’t you just write what you have to say with a picture on instagram anyway or post on Facebook both are the same exact concepts,1,16-07-2023 7:18

App Store,Can you add a poll feature in threads? It would be helpful,4,20-08-2023 0:28

App Store,"I don’t know why Instagram hates iPad users. But this is a new low. There’s no good reason that there isn’t a native app for the iPad, but actively blocking iPad users from using the web app is just hateful. I’m done with threads.",1,26-08-2023 9:06
App Store,Threads itself is good. The app needs to be upgraded to use the full screen on my iPad and not display only phone-sized.,3,19-07-2023 13:32

App Store,"There is nothing original about this app. It’s literally a copy and paste of twitter with 80% less features. Meta states that there’s over 100k signups but the reality is that it’s more like 100k instagram imports. Regardless, app needs to add new stuff quick or it will die.",1,15-07-2023 5:09
App Store,I can’t use Threads and Instagram simultaneously. I get logged out each time I try to use one or the other.,3,07-07-2023 8:19
App Store,I guess it could hve a Dm feature and can record 20sec  voice note too ..I love thread 💕🧚‍♂️,5,10-07-2023 20:07
App Store,"The format is bland and boring.
Now matter who you follow, you won’t see their posts. But you do get to see everyone else’s, regardless of your follow list.
Did I mention it’s bland? There is no excitement there, nothing to grab a user’s attention.

App Store,This app’s got the internet now,5,06-07-2023 20:19
App Store,Both facebook and this new “threads” app is 1984. Warning you not to follow any republicans with warnings before you follow. I hate all meta apps. Either be a free speech platform and welcome everyone or lose everyone sooner or later.,1,06-07-2023 19:02
App Store,Great app ! Feels just like a big group chat ❤️,5,06-07-2023 18:26

App Store,What an awful service. I’m flooded with garbage threads from companies and folk I don’t know or want to know. And there’s no option to tell the app to only show me thread from the folk I follow. Don’t bother with this app until they fix this.,1,18-07-2023 14:48
App Store,"I don’t want Instagram. I thought this was a different app from Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. I just want Threads without having to get a Facebook or Instagram account. As far as I can tell, y’all are no different than Twitter or Elon.",1,12-07-2023 23:14
App Store,Please give us language translation thanks 💯🔥,4,07-07-2023 16:22
App Store,"Won’t let me post, and won’t let me add a second thread. Extremely buggy right now. Assuming it’s the demand causing problems. But imo should have been rolled out exclusively not to mass market",1,11-07-2023 13:56

App Store,"To be superior over twitter you need : DMS , budget fix with following , freedom of speech and fast Customer service",3,06-07-2023 23:24

App Store,"having no hashtag support at launch is a total blunder. hate the inability to have drafts as well. i’m also not so happy about how it links back to instagram. there are followers i’d rather not carry over from my personal accounts to a microblog medium where ideas are a little more haphazard and messy or if using threads more professionally, it doesn’t make sense to inflict my dull industry conversations onto my friends",1,10-08-2023 17:16

App Store,"Warning. This app is sneaky. 

Also makes you think friends intentionally are waiting to add you as friend requests but it’s bc it’s so easy to answer yes to sending an invite to all your existing IG requests. It words it in a sneaky way to make you give it permission. Careful. 

And it advertised itself as a “messaging” app in an IG ad. I thought it was like Messenger for FB. Tricky. 

Also no clear benefit over Twitter.",1,20-07-2023 6:58

App Store,"Threads does what it’s intended; it’s a nice, emerging alternative to Twitter, with all of the infrastructure and ease of use ready to go. But there’s things it could do better. 

First of all, the app’s functionality is smart. As I wrote, the friction is nonexistent, and it’s almost too easy to integrate all of your platforms. I love the idea of this app being decentralized, and I hope that’s something that Instagram develops well, as decentralization can make further integration even easier and eliminate issues peculiar to other platforms. 

I didn’t attempt the other alternatives (I last accessed Mastodon perhaps in 2018 and so my opinion is invalid there), but because I already have Instagram and an honest Instagram following, this was the easiest with the least friction to jump into. As a result, I can’t compare Threads to anything but Twitter. And among the features it’s most missing is Twitter’s feed curation. 

 Social networks thrive when they give us greater choice in terms of what we desire to consume. I don’t desire to read the posts of vapid celebrities when my only use case for this type of social network is sports, a handful of other niche interests, and seeing what friends are interested in or talking about. Instead, we see people who are famous for being famous. According to some who disliked Threads, this is where they fumbled the ball, and so they likely could have drawn even more engagement than the incredible numbers they have drawn already if their feeds were a blank slate or correlated with the feeds they already curated on Instagram via a recommendation algorithm. If they replicate Instagram’s feed presentation with fewer interstitial posts (or Threads), and replicate Twitter’s function of being able to follow and engage with Topics that you enjoy, and develop thus a feedback loop of similar content to fill your feed instead of people you don’t know (or at least have them relegated to a separate Recommended tab), this could be infinitely better than even Twitter. I would also like for Threads to retain its small–user feel; everyone feels important, and that’s cool. Allow us to have a chronological order to our feed as well, or even reverse chronology, if we’re interested in that sort of thing. A dark mode for those whose smartphones aren’t set in dark mode. Better presentation in Settings would be great as well; it’s a bit of a mare’s nest at the moment. Provide us with more rational choice. 

I’d like to see the implementation of a separate tab with local, regional or national news, similar perhaps to Facebook (which I haven’t used since 2014 and so have no familiarity with) as well as Twitter, and that’ll make it even better. Avoid replicating where Twitter has gone objectively wrong, too — such as a two–tiered hierarchical system in which individuals who pay a fee have primacy and those who don’t have none. A better, less clunky GUI similar to that of Instagram’s breezy, sleek GUI with old Twitter’s level of order and presentation, as well as Threads’ simplicity, would be great. Better video functionality would be great, too. I already know Instagram is great at developing and integrating new features; I can see a Communities feature á la Telegram. (Please allow us to exercise consent and choice with respect to future gimmickry.) 

I edited this paragraph after some two to three hours of use. Accessibility is important — and that’s what Threads is missing at the moment. Instagram does accessibility relatively well with captions, alt text, and translation. Perhaps even integrate tone indicators. I can imagine how a person who doesn’t speak English would feel acute linguistic isolation here.

Another choice they can give us is in the customization of not only our feeds, but also our accounts and user experience. This also includes empowering us with the choice to retain data we choose not to share, and thus not only address preexisting privacy concerns (another valid concern about this app), but also allow for expansion into the European Union. Allow us to import posts from other platforms (which I believe fediverse governance will certainly facilitate), or even export them from, say, Twitter. Allow us to have our own display names and other customizable presentational features; allow us to deactivate without having to deactivate our Instagram, or even allow us to delete our accounts off Threads, and don’t force Threads onto Instagram users who only have interest in or provide imaginal content on Instagram. Give us choice and power. Develop a unique identity in which the user is king of his destiny, not ruled by an algo’s nudges and whims. And you’ll have a winner — a true “Twitter killer” in which Twitter is reduced to “the other app.” 

I see this being a great app, but it really depends on the people at the helm and product managers listening to consumer feedback (including mountains of consumer feedback from Twitter’s failures over the years as well as looking within to its parent company’s other subsidiaries and their failures) and constantly improving. Color me skeptical; I have no reason to believe any company will do the right thing, but I’m welcome to being proven wrong, because this surely has everything going for it — and, as far as I see, it’s all going in the right direction.

Twitter was important for me, not only for sports and social integration but also especially for news during natural or unnatural disasters, especially since my city’s local news base has declined drastically despite us being especially vulnerable to tornadoes, floods and violence. Twitter’s decline and self–inflicted technical difficulties has complicated all of that privileged access. Threads can not only step in that breach, but also mend it — and not only for me, but for tens of thousands of others. So far, I and many others can see the Sun rising for Threads. Now, it’s up to you all at Instagram to keep the ball rolling.",4,07-07-2023 18:05

App Store,"So far I’m really liking this app, but there are many key features that are missing that I feel should have been present with the initial release. Here is a list of features I think this app should have to thrive (especially to compete with twitter wink wink)

1. Please for the love of god add an option to upload photos in 4K. The whole point of having an app to compete with twitter is to have photos in amazing quality. How’s the time to actually do your part and integrate that feature

2. An edit option (cmon now…) this should already be in the app as a feature. Let us edit posts.

3. Discover tab and following tab. There should be a tab or filter that allows you to only see posts of the people you follow. No one wants to see these celebrities that genuinely no one gives a rats behind about. Also a discover tab will allow people to find users or posts through hashtags or by allowing people to see whatever is trending. 

4. If you want to be better than Twitter then let us download videos the same way we can download photos. Cmon bro it’s not that hard just make it work. 

5. I know this is a shot in the dark but…there should really be an option for censoring posts, which allows nsfw to exist on the app without harming people who don’t want to see it. Allowing a disclaimer to show before viewing a post is a good way to do so. 

6. Allow users to create lists of their favorite accounts/posts so they can easily go back to them and find what they liked in the past. 

7. Include a tab on the account for photos/videos only similar to a gallery. 

8. Allow people to make group chats and dm each other privately.

9. Longer video upload duration 

10. Allow us to edit/crop photos or videos before posting. And also let us schedule posts/save drafts.

I think all these things will really improve the app and allow it to thrive as much as we all want it to. So take it into consideration (:",3,10-07-2023 16:19

App Store,"As an avid user of social media apps, I was excited to give Threads a try, hoping it would offer a fresh and streamlined experience for connecting with my friends. However, my experience with this app has been nothing short of disappointing and frustrating.

First and foremost, the app's user interface is cluttered and confusing. It lacks intuitive design, making it difficult to navigate and find the features I was looking for. It seems like the developers prioritized aesthetics over functionality, resulting in a convoluted and counterintuitive experience.

Moreover, Threads fails to deliver on its core promise of fostering meaningful connections. Instead of providing a simple and efficient way to communicate with close friends, the app inundates users with unnecessary notifications and updates. The constant bombardment of status updates, stories, and messages from acquaintances quickly becomes overwhelming and distracting.

Furthermore, the app's performance is abysmal. It lags and crashes frequently, which is frustrating when trying to engage in conversations or upload media. It seems that Threads is plagued by technical issues, and the developers have not prioritized fixing these problems, even after multiple updates.

Another major letdown is the lack of customization options. Threads provides very limited control over privacy settings and customization preferences. It feels like a one-size-fits-all approach, leaving users with little choice in how they want to engage with the app and share their personal information.

Lastly, the integration with Instagram feels forced and unnecessary. The app seems more like an extension of Instagram rather than a standalone platform, offering little added value or unique features. It fails to establish its own identity, leaving users wondering why they should use Threads instead of sticking to Instagram's existing messaging functionalities.

In conclusion, Threads app has left me disappointed and frustrated with its cluttered interface, overwhelming notifications, poor performance, lack of customization, and a lackluster integration with Instagram. I would not recommend wasting your time and energy on this app when there are better alternatives available that actually deliver on their promises of seamless communication and user experience.",1,07-07-2023 13:54

App Store,"This is supposedly the “nicer” alternative to twitter (their words, not mine) so let me ask:

Does that mean useless bans like before? Does this mean force feeding opinions like before? Does this mean I can’t even share my account unless I have a link? Does this mean taking one billionaire’s word for it over another just because one isn’t bending the knee to a political ideology? Is this a breeding ground for cancelling to thrive again? Does this mean I have to like every piece of music a major artist puts out and if I don’t, then I’ll be bullied into not giving an honest review? Does this mean I trust the guy who was interviewed at the White House for snooping through our privacy and down right doxx-ing over 50+ million of Users? Does this mean I have to support a thief who stole insider secrets because I don’t agree with everything the owner does because HE doesn’t agree with everything I say on my twitter or believe?

These are legitimate questions I have. It’s a cash grab on the vulnerable because mark my words lol they will roll out a subscription service ASAP and with ALL that said they can’t even put search?! no easy way to find a thread user, no originality, no variety of opinions from left right and center. Just a nice cozy place to pander, play politics, keep society in check and blow smoke up each others…fill in the blanks. 

This app is utterly pointless. All that money and you can’t use it to fund new, exciting social media that changes the game. It’s clearly something personal with Mark because again for the third time…what’s original and groundbreaking about this app? Anyone? I’ll die waiting for an answer.",1,13-07-2023 23:38

App Store,"“Threads by Instagram” feels less like a competent social media platform and more like a hastily assembled alpha project. This app is undercooked, to say the least, making its release to the public both perplexing and frustrating.

From a feature standpoint, the app is strikingly barebones. Even the most basic functionalities you would expect from a social platform seem to be MIA. It’s as though the development team decided to launch before the project was halfway complete. I hope this isn’t indicative of Instagram’s new quality standards.

What’s more, the app feels like a poorly-executed attempt to mimic Twitter. I’m all for drawing inspiration, but blatant imitation without bringing anything new to the table is just unoriginal. Sadly, “Threads” offers nothing that would make it a worthwhile alternative to the well-established micro-blogging giant. Oh and it’s loaded with porn spam bots. Fun… Not!

Perhaps the most concerning aspect of “Threads” is the slant it seems to have towards specific political narratives. An inclusive social platform should foster a balanced dialogue from all perspectives. It’s disheartening to see an app, especially from an industry leader like Instagram, seemingly fuel the flames of partisanship instead of encouraging diverse discourse.

Overall, “Threads by Instagram” is a puzzling and disappointing venture. It’s an alpha product that doesn’t deserve a place on your phone until significant improvements are made. If Instagram invested heavily in this project, I can only hope they take these criticisms to heart and pivot towards a more user-centric, balanced, and innovative design.",1,07-07-2023 3:49

Threads has the most amazing environments and definitely not as toxic as some of the others. Now, is it possible that this will change in the future?  Absolutely.

Lets be honest Elon Musk doesn’t know what he’s doing… threads is quite literally a carbon copy of the OLDER twitter(still kinda current twitter?) The difference is like not limiting post and technically everything Elon Musk is doing right now with the app.Like now it’s called “X” like dude no one is gonna call that app “X”.It’s stupid and is kinda ruining the idea of twitter and the whole bird thingy y’know. I like threads it’s cool and even though it is a copy everything the owners or ceos and whatever,they are doing right keeping the old idea of twitter and just like not changing it I guess. I understand that it can be from my perspective but I genuinely don't care what everyone else says threads is doing everything right.It’ll never beat original twitter before Elon musk, but hey at least it’s doing better now then “X’s” current condition.This definitely turned out longer then it should have lol. Still kind of short compare to other reviews though so I guess not point in complaining, ay?",4,04-08-2023 5:31

Others seem to be having better luck. But as far as I’m concerned, this app is useless as it stands at the moment",2,09-08-2023 13:30

I probably need to follow back about 20 per day and often find 5-10 new people I’d like to follow. But after about 15 follows, I get locked out with a screen saying “Try again later. We restrict certain activity to protect our community”. At least 4 times I’ve been suspended because I’ve followed too quickly (maybe 10-15 people). I don’t do it without vetting. I comment or like posts in between, & do everything possible to avoid restrictions. Threads makes me enter a captcha code, enter another code from an email, and then a 3rd code from a text. Then they immediately unsuspend me. I get that they don’t want bots, but this is ridiculous. Today I’ve currently been unable to follow at all for 36 hours.

App Store,It’s nice to have options and not have to be on twitter all the time in it’s toxic environment. While Threads still has time to change into a toxic environment as of right now it is very chill. A great thing Meta has done with the release of threads is that it gives competition to twitter but a not so great thing is that while it is similar to twitter it also has similarities to Metas other company Instagram and Instagram has become increasingly less active since the release of Threads. Also add me on threads and insta @therealremisaurus,5,07-07-2023 6:22
App Store,I like the app so far and the people on here is really funny and friendly and I got a lot of followers fast but I just wish u can clear ur activity because now I cant see who tried to follow me and to follow them back I have to go through all my followers and go to each account to see who I don’t follow back but it’s coo app other then that .,5,07-07-2023 5:51

It still needs some work and more features like an addition of gifs, a “saved” feature option like there is on Instagram, include the messaging/calls/video calls on the app like insta, and include a trending page on the search bar area so we can see the top 10/15/20 trending topics or hashtags, just an idea to throw out there so that it can be more fun to use.
