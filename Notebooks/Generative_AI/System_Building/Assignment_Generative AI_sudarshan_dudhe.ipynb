    "This notebook explores the application of OpenAI's powerful APIs, particularly the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) model, to create a chatbot capable of summarizing articles and generating questions and answers (QA) based on their content. By ingesting user-provided information such as article text and desired summarization length, the chatbot produces concise summaries tailored to individual needs. Drawing inspiration from the remarkable success of transformer models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E, this research investigates their potential in transforming article understanding and engagement through summarization and QA generation. Using illustrative code examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer models in generating informative summaries and relevant questions. Additionally, we delve into the underlying mechanisms of these models and showcase their adaptability in addressing various article comprehension tasks. By integrating OpenAI's APIs into the development process, we underscore the accessibility and scalability of leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies for article summarization and QA generation, thereby highlighting their significant role in advancing natural language processing capabilities.\n"

       "'Sample Level II CFA Program\\nItem-Set Questions\\nTOPIC: ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS\\nTOTAL POINT VALUE OF THIS QUESTION SET IS 12 POINTS\\nEdgar Somer, CFA, was recently hired as a portfolio manager at Karibe Investment\\nManagement. Somer previously worked at a rival firm where he produced an average annual\\nreturn of 11% using a small-cap value strategy.\\nOn his first day at Karibe, the firm asks Somer to approve marketing materials that present the\\nfollowing performance disclosures.\\n• Text which states: “Somer has generated average annual returns of 11%”\\n• The 3-year performance of a composite of Karibe client accounts that follow a similar\\nsmall-cap value strategy\\n• A disclosure that the assumptions and calculations underlying the returns presented are\\npublicly available on Karibe’s public website\\nTo maintain relationships with clients and to attract prospective clients, Somer is active on\\nsocial media. He posts a link to a news story about a famous athlete who recently paid\\nsubstantial tax penalties after failing to properly report investment gains. In addition to the link\\nSomer writes the comment: “A client of mine had similar gains, but because I kept proper\\nrecords he faced no penalties. #HireAProfessional”. Some responses to the post suggest that\\nreaders mistakenly believe the athlete is Somer’s client. Somer does not post a clarifying\\ncomment.\\nSomer develops a new quantitative investment strategy that he describes in marketing\\nmaterials. The description states that “the strategy is based on eight proven fundamental and\\ntechnical factors, including well-known factors such as value and momentum as well as certain\\nproprietary factors that have been back-tested. The strategy includes a dynamic weighting\\ncomponent to adjust the amount allocated to each factor based on prevailing market\\nconditions.” The materials also highlight risks such as “the possibility that the model or its\\nunderlying factors may not work out of sample,” and “because the weight placed on various\\nfactors is dynamic, it may not be suitable for clients who seek steady exposure to certain\\nfactors.” One of Somer’s clients agrees to use this strategy. When preparing the first\\nperformance report for this client, Somer discovers a coding error that reversed the client’s\\nweightings assigned to the value and momentum factors.\\nPrior to joining Karibe, Somer purchased shares in a small-cap technology firm for his personal\\nportfolio. When he started his new role Somers disclosed the position, which had quadrupled in\\nvalue since the initial purchase and represented more than 5% of his personal holdings. He hadno intention to sell the shares and he recommended them to clients at Karibe, to whom he\\ndisclosed his ownership. After the successful launch of a new product resulted in additional\\nlarge gains in the shares, Somer now recommends that clients place limit orders when\\npurchasing the shares. Though he remains bullish on the stock he is concerned about the size of\\nhis personal position, which is now more than 15% of his portfolio. One of his clients recently\\nplaced a limit order at $50 per share, which represents the highest bid in the market. The\\nlowest offer is $52. Somer considers filling the client’s order with some of his own shares at the\\n$50 bid price.\\n1. To best comply with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct (the Standards)\\nrelated to performance presentation, Somer should modify the:\\nA. text regarding Somer’s investment returns.\\nB. presentation of the performance for Karibe’s representative composite.\\nC. content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations.\\n2. Does Somer’s social media post result in a violation of the Standards?\\nA. No.\\nB. Yes, he violates the standard related to preservation of confidentiality.\\nC. Yes, he violates the standard related to communication with clients and prospective\\nclients.\\n3. When preparing the marketing materials for the quantitative strategy, did Somer comply\\nwith the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients?\\nA. Yes.\\nB. No, because he did not identify the risk of coding errors.\\nC. No, because he did not describe the investment process in detail.\\n4. If he fills the client’s order for shares of the technology firm, would Somer violate the\\nstandard related to priority of transactions?\\nA. No.\\nB.

When preparing the marketing materials for the quantitative strategy, did Somer comply\\nwith the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients?\\nA. Yes.\\nB. No, because he did not identify the risk of coding errors.\\nC. No, because he did not describe the investment process in detail.\\nAnswer: A\\nA is correct because he did not violate Standard V(B). With respect to informing clients of the\\ninvestment process, the guidance stipulates that when explaining the process one “need not\\ndescribe the investment system in detail… but must inform clients of (the) basic process and\\nlogic.” The explanation of Somer’s process as factor-based with weights dynamically allocated\\nmeets this criterion. Regarding risk identification, “members and candidates cannot be\\nexpected to disclose risks they are unaware of at the time…. Having no knowledge of a risk or\\nlimitation that subsequently triggers a loss may reveal a deficiency in the diligence and\\nreasonable basis… but may not reveal a breach of Standard V(B).”\\nB is incorrect because “members and candidates cannot be expected to disclose risks they are\\nunaware of at the time….

If he fills the client’s order for shares of the technology firm, would Somer violate the\\nstandard related to priority of transactions?\\nA. No.B. Yes, because the client would be disadvantaged by the trade.\\nC. Yes, because he would benefit personally from a trade undertaken for a client.\\nAnswer: C\\nC is correct because the guidance for Standard VI(B) specifies that “nothing is inherently\\nunethical about… making money from personal investments as long as (1) the client is not\\ndisadvantaged by the trade, (2) the investment professional does not personally benefit from\\ntrades undertaken for clients, and (3) the investment professional complies with applicable\\nregulatory requirements.” In this case, Somer would personally benefit from a trade\\nundertaken for a client by realizing a large gain and reducing the portfolio risk arising from his\\nlarge position, which results in several potential conflicts of interest. At a minimum he would\\nneed to disclose to the client that he was filling the order from his own account and seek\\npermission from Karibe to do so.\\nA is incorrect because Somer would personally benefit from a trade undertaken for a client by\\nrealizing a large gain and reducing the portfolio risk arising from his large position, which results\\nin several potential conflicts of interest. At a minimum he would need to disclose to the client\\nthat he was filling the order from his own account and seek permission from Karibe to do so.\\nB is incorrect because the client is not disadvantaged by the trade (and in fact gets the order\\nfilled at a discount to the prevailing market price).\\n5. The AFFO per share for Autier REIT over the last 12-months is closest to:\\nA. $6.80.\\nB. $7.16.\\nC. $8.43\\nAnswer: A\\nA is correct because \"AFFO is most often defined as FFO adjusted to remove any non-cash rent\\nand to subtract maintenance-type capital expenditures and leasing costs (including leasing\\nagent\\'s commissions and tenants\\' improvement allowances)\" The computation for Autier REIT\\nis as follows:\\nLast 12-Months Funds From Operations (FFO) $877.42 million\\nLess: Non-Cash Rents 20.55 million\\nLess: Recurring CapEx (Maintenance) 54.52 million\\nLess: Leasing Cost & Tenant Allowances 19.34 millionAdjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) $783.01 million\\nTo arrive at Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) per share, divide AFFO by the number of\\nshares outstanding (115.15 million).\\nCorrect AFFO per share = $783.01 / 115.15 = $6.7999 ≈ $6.80\\nB is incorrect. In this case non-cash rents get added to FFO instead of subtracting them.\\nC is incorrect. In this case the adjustments are added instead of subtracted.\\n6. The NAVPS for Bissorte REIT is closest to:\\nA. $129.34.\\nB. $130.43.\\nC. $133.51.\\nAnswer: C\\nC is correct because \"NAVPS is the difference between a real estate company’s assets and its\\nliabilities, all taken at current market values instead of accounting book values, divided by the\\nnumber of shares outstanding\" The Net Asset Value (NAV) for Bissorte REIT is correctly\\ncomputed as:\\nNet Operating Income (Last 12 Months) $1,826.12 million\\nLess: Non-Cash Rents 0.00 million\\nTimes: (1+ Forecast growth in NOI) x 1.015\\nEstimated Next 12-Months Cash NOI $1,853.51 million\\nDivide: Capitalization Rate / 0.0575\\nEstimated Value of Operating Real Estate $32,234.99 million\\nPlus: Cash and Equivalents 140.63 million\\nPlus: A/R and Prepaids/Other Assets 504.32 million\\nLess: Total Debt & Other Liabilities 12,236.03 million\\nNet Asset Value (NAV) $20,643.91 million\\nThe candidate then divides the NAV computed above by the number of shares Bissorte REIT has\\noutstanding (154.62) to arrive at the correct NAVPS.\\nCorrect NAVPS = $20,643.91 / 154.62 = $133.51A is incorrect. In this case the current assets of \"Cash and Equivalents\" and \"Accounts\\nReceivable and Prepaid/Other Assets\" in the computation of NAV are not added back.\\nB is incorrect. In this case NAV is computed using the next 12-months forecast NOI, not last 12-\\nmonths NOI as presented in the exhibit.\\n7. The most appropriate method for estimating the intrinsic value of OceanFront is based on:\\nA. P/AFFO.\\nB. net asset value.\\nC. Discounted cash flow.\\nAnswer: B\\nB is correct because net asset value (NAV) explicitly considers \"land held for future\\ndevelopment\" and is not affected by changes in dividends. As noted in the case, \"In a recent\\nanalyst conference call the CEO of OceanFront announced plans to increase the firm’s retention\\nratio to fund several new acquisitions and development projects. Specifically, he explained that\\nOceanFront recently acquired several vacant lots in a popular beach-front community following\\na zoning change which allows for construction of high-rise condominiums.\" Thus, OceanFront\\nhas recently acquired \"land held for future development\" and the transactions are recent. This\\ncombined with the fact that dividends are being lowered to begin development of these\\nproperties makes NAV the best choice for estimating OceanFront\\'s intrinsic value.\\nA is incorrect because \"applying a multiple to FFO or AFFO may not capture the intrinsic value of\\nall real estate assets held by the REIT or REOC; for example, land parcels and empty buildings may\\nnot currently produce income and hence do not contribute to FFO (and AFFO) but have value”.\\nC is incorrect because the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach is most appropriate and\\napplicable when REITs and REOCs \"return a significant portion of their income to their investors.\"\\nIn this case, \"In a recent analyst conference call the CEO of OceanFront announced plans to\\nsignificantly increase the firm’s retention ratio to fund several new acquisitions and development\\nprojects”.\\n8. If the client implements Rousseau’s recommendation, the number of gold futures contracts\\nin his portfolio will most likely:\\nA. decrease.\\nB. stay the same.\\nC. increase.\\nAnswer: AA is correct because \"gold futures are currently in contango\" and will require buying fewer\\ncontracts to meet Rousseau\\'s goal of \"maintaining the same dollar exposure in gold futures.\" In\\nthe readings: \"A portfolio may require buying more far contracts than the near contracts being\\nsold. Investors can observe this scenario if backwardation is driving the shape of the commodity\\nfutures price curve.\" In the opposite case, if the futures price curve shape is being driven by\\ncontango–with a higher futures price in the far contract–this scenario will require the purchase\\nof fewer commodity contracts than in the near position.\\nB is incorrect because \"gold futures are currently in contango\" and will require buying fewer\\ncontracts to meet Rousseau\\'s goal of \"maintaining the same dollar exposure in gold futures.\" The\\nnumber of required contracts would only remain the same if the price of the expiring near\\ncontract is equal to the price of the far contract the investor is rolling into.\\nC is incorrect because \"gold futures are currently in contango\" and will require buying fewer\\ncontracts to meet Rousseau\\'s goal of \"maintaining the same dollar exposure in gold futures,\" not\\nmore contracts. The number of required contracts would only increase if the futures market was\\nin backwardation.'"

    "The provided code snippet demonstrates a function called `chunk_text`, which splits a given text into smaller chunks based on a specified maximum number of tokens per chunk. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition:**\n",
    "   - The `chunk_text` function takes two parameters:\n",
    "     - `text`: The input text that needs to be chunked into smaller pieces.\n",
    "     - `max_chunk_tokens`: An integer representing the maximum number of tokens allowed per chunk. The default value is set to 1000 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Splitting Text into Chunks:**\n",
    "   - The function begins by splitting the input text into individual words, assuming that the text is already tokenized into words.\n",
    "   - It initializes empty lists to store the resulting chunks, as well as variables to keep track of the current chunk being constructed and the total token count.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Iterating Over Words:**\n",
    "   - The function iterates over each word in the input text.\n",
    "   - For each word, it calculates the number of tokens in the word by splitting it based on whitespace.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Chunking Logic:**\n",
    "   - It checks if adding the current word to the current chunk would exceed the maximum token limit (`max_chunk_tokens`).\n",
    "   - If adding the word would keep the chunk within the limit, the word is appended to the current chunk, and the token count is updated.\n",
    "   - If adding the word would exceed the limit, the current chunk is added to the list of chunks, and a new chunk is started with the current word.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Handling the Last Chunk:**\n",
    "   - Once all words have been processed, the function adds the last remaining chunk to the list of chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return Value:**\n",
    "   - The function returns a list containing the resulting text chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Example Usage:**\n",
    "   - An example usage of the `chunk_text` function is provided, where it is applied to a PDF text extracted from a file (`pdf_text`). The resulting chunks are printed along with their corresponding indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this function provides a convenient way to break down large text data into manageable chunks, which can be useful for various text processing tasks, such as natural language processing or summarization.\n"

      "Chunk 1: Sample Level II CFA Program Item-Set Questions TOPIC: ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS TOTAL POINT VALUE OF THIS QUESTION SET IS 12 POINTS Edgar Somer, CFA, was recently hired as a portfolio manager at Karibe Investment Management. Somer previously worked at a rival firm where he produced an average annual return of 11% using a small-cap value strategy. On his first day at Karibe, the firm asks Somer to approve marketing materials that present the following performance disclosures. • Text which states: “Somer has generated average annual returns of 11%” • The 3-year performance of a composite of Karibe client accounts that follow a similar small-cap value strategy • A disclosure that the assumptions and calculations underlying the returns presented are publicly available on Karibe’s public website To maintain relationships with clients and to attract prospective clients, Somer is active on social media. He posts a link to a news story about a famous athlete who recently paid substantial tax penalties after failing to properly report investment gains. In addition to the link Somer writes the comment: “A client of mine had similar gains, but because I kept proper records he faced no penalties. #HireAProfessional”. Some responses to the post suggest that readers mistakenly believe the athlete is Somer’s client. Somer does not post a clarifying comment. Somer develops a new quantitative investment strategy that he describes in marketing materials. The description states that “the strategy is based on eight proven fundamental and technical factors, including well-known factors such as value and momentum as well as certain proprietary factors that have been back-tested. The strategy includes a dynamic weighting component to adjust the amount allocated to each factor based on prevailing market conditions.” The materials also highlight risks such as “the possibility that the model or its underlying factors may not work out of sample,” and “because the weight placed on various factors is dynamic, it may not be suitable for clients who seek steady exposure to certain factors.” One of Somer’s clients agrees to use this strategy. When preparing the first performance report for this client, Somer discovers a coding error that reversed the client’s weightings assigned to the value and momentum factors. Prior to joining Karibe, Somer purchased shares in a small-cap technology firm for his personal portfolio. When he started his new role Somers disclosed the position, which had quadrupled in value since the initial purchase and represented more than 5% of his personal holdings. He hadno intention to sell the shares and he recommended them to clients at Karibe, to whom he disclosed his ownership. After the successful launch of a new product resulted in additional large gains in the shares, Somer now recommends that clients place limit orders when purchasing the shares. Though he remains bullish on the stock he is concerned about the size of his personal position, which is now more than 15% of his portfolio. One of his clients recently placed a limit order at $50 per share, which represents the highest bid in the market. The lowest offer is $52. Somer considers filling the client’s order with some of his own shares at the $50 bid price. 1. To best comply with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct (the Standards) related to performance presentation, Somer should modify the: A. text regarding Somer’s investment returns. B. presentation of the performance for Karibe’s representative composite. C. content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations. 2. Does Somer’s social media post result in a violation of the Standards? A. No. B. Yes, he violates the standard related to preservation of confidentiality. C. Yes, he violates the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients. 3. When preparing the marketing materials for the quantitative strategy, did Somer comply with the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients? A. Yes. B. No, because he did not identify the risk of coding errors. C. No, because he did not describe the investment process in detail. 4. If he fills the client’s order for shares of the technology firm, would Somer violate the standard related to priority of transactions? A. No. B.

To best comply with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct (the Standards) related to performance presentation, Somer should modify the: A. text regarding Somer’s investment returns. B. presentation of the performance for Karibe’s representative composite. C. content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations. Answer: A A is correct because Somer’s returns are not clearly explained as being generated at his prior firm. If a firm is not claiming GIPS compliance, “Members and candidates can also meet their obligations under Standard III(D) by including disclosures that fully explain the performance being reported.” B is incorrect because the marketing materials present the performance of a composite of similar portfolios. C is incorrect because the materials direct prospective clients to the website where a full disclosure of the assumptions and calculations are available 2. Does Somer’s social media post result in a violation of the Standards? A. No. B. Yes, he violates the standard related to preservation of confidentiality. C. Yes, he violates the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients. Answer: A A is correct because Somer did not reveal the identity of his client (Standard III(E)). The context of the comment (he helped his client avoid penalties) contradicts the mistaken conclusion of the readers of the social media post (the athlete in question had to pay penalties so obviously was not his client). He also does not violate the standard related to communication (Standard V(B)) because it applies to 1) disclosure of the format and general principles of the investment process; 2) significant limitations and risks of the investment process; 3) identifying important factors for their analysis and recommendations; and 4) distinguishing between fact and opinion in investment analyses and recommendations. His post did not relate to any of these and thus is not a potential violation of the standard. B is incorrect because Somer does not violate the standard related to confidentiality because the athlete in the news story is not his client, and the information that he helped his own clientavoid tax penalties by keeping good records does not provide enough information to disclose the client’s identity. C is incorrect because Somer does not violate the standard related to communication (Standard V(B)) because it applies to 1) disclosure of the format and general principles of the investment process; 2) significant limitations and risks of the investment process; 3) identifying important factors for their analysis and recommendations; and 4) distinguishing between fact and opinion in investment analyses and recommendations. His post did not relate to any of these and thus is not a potential violation of the standard, but certain candidates and/or exam team writers who think that communications with clients includes a duty to correct everyone who misunderstands you may choose this answer. 3. When preparing the marketing materials for the quantitative strategy, did Somer comply with the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients? A. Yes. B. No, because he did not identify the risk of coding errors. C. No, because he did not describe the investment process in detail. Answer: A A is correct because he did not violate Standard V(B). With respect to informing clients of the investment process, the guidance stipulates that when explaining the process one “need not describe the investment system in detail… but must inform clients of (the) basic process and logic.” The explanation of Somer’s process as factor-based with weights dynamically allocated meets this criterion. Regarding risk identification, “members and candidates cannot be expected to disclose risks they are unaware of at the time…. Having no knowledge of a risk or limitation that subsequently triggers a loss may reveal a deficiency in the diligence and reasonable basis… but may not reveal a breach of Standard V(B).” B is incorrect because “members and candidates cannot be expected to disclose risks they are unaware of at the time…. Having no knowledge of a risk or limitation that subsequently triggers a loss may reveal a deficiency in the diligence and reasonable basis… but may not reveal a breach of Standard V(B).” C is incorrect because when explaining the process one “need not describe the investment system in detail… but must inform clients of (the) basic process and logic.” (Example 1 p. 141) The explanation of Somer’s process as factor-based with weights dynamically allocated meets this criterion. 4. If he fills the client’s order for shares of the technology firm, would Somer violate the standard related to priority of transactions? A. No.B. Yes, because the client would be disadvantaged by the trade. C. Yes, because he would benefit personally from a trade undertaken for a client. Answer: C C is correct because the guidance for Standard VI(B) specifies that “nothing is inherently unethical about… making money from personal investments as long as (1) the client is not disadvantaged by the trade, (2) the investment professional does not personally benefit from trades undertaken for clients, and (3) the investment professional complies with applicable regulatory requirements.”\n",
      "Chunk 3: In this case, Somer would personally benefit from a trade undertaken for a client by realizing a large gain and reducing the portfolio risk arising from his large position, which results in several potential conflicts of interest. At a minimum he would need to disclose to the client that he was filling the order from his own account and seek permission from Karibe to do so. A is incorrect because Somer would personally benefit from a trade undertaken for a client by realizing a large gain and reducing the portfolio risk arising from his large position, which results in several potential conflicts of interest. At a minimum he would need to disclose to the client that he was filling the order from his own account and seek permission from Karibe to do so. B is incorrect because the client is not disadvantaged by the trade (and in fact gets the order filled at a discount to the prevailing market price). 5. The AFFO per share for Autier REIT over the last 12-months is closest to: A. $6.80. B. $7.16. C. $8.43 Answer: A A is correct because \"AFFO is most often defined as FFO adjusted to remove any non-cash rent and to subtract maintenance-type capital expenditures and leasing costs (including leasing agent's commissions and tenants' improvement allowances)\" The computation for Autier REIT is as follows: Last 12-Months Funds From Operations (FFO) $877.42 million Less: Non-Cash Rents 20.55 million Less: Recurring CapEx (Maintenance) 54.52 million Less: Leasing Cost & Tenant Allowances 19.34 millionAdjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) $783.01 million To arrive at Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) per share, divide AFFO by the number of shares outstanding (115.15 million). Correct AFFO per share = $783.01 / 115.15 = $6.7999 ≈ $6.80 B is incorrect. In this case non-cash rents get added to FFO instead of subtracting them. C is incorrect. In this case the adjustments are added instead of subtracted. 6. The NAVPS for Bissorte REIT is closest to: A. $129.34. B. $130.43. C. $133.51. Answer: C C is correct because \"NAVPS is the difference between a real estate company’s assets and its liabilities, all taken at current market values instead of accounting book values, divided by the number of shares outstanding\" The Net Asset Value (NAV) for Bissorte REIT is correctly computed as: Net Operating Income (Last 12 Months) $1,826.12 million Less: Non-Cash Rents 0.00 million Times: (1+ Forecast growth in NOI) x 1.015 Estimated Next 12-Months Cash NOI $1,853.51 million Divide: Capitalization Rate / 0.0575 Estimated Value of Operating Real Estate $32,234.99 million Plus: Cash and Equivalents 140.63 million Plus: A/R and Prepaids/Other Assets 504.32 million Less: Total Debt & Other Liabilities 12,236.03 million Net Asset Value (NAV) $20,643.91 million The candidate then divides the NAV computed above by the number of shares Bissorte REIT has outstanding (154.62) to arrive at the correct NAVPS. Correct NAVPS = $20,643.91 / 154.62 = $133.51A is incorrect. In this case the current assets of \"Cash and Equivalents\" and \"Accounts Receivable and Prepaid/Other Assets\" in the computation of NAV are not added back. B is incorrect. In this case NAV is computed using the next 12-months forecast NOI, not last 12- months NOI as presented in the exhibit. 7. The most appropriate method for estimating the intrinsic value of OceanFront is based on: A. P/AFFO. B. net asset value. C. Discounted cash flow. Answer: B B is correct because net asset value (NAV) explicitly considers \"land held for future development\" and is not affected by changes in dividends. As noted in the case, \"In a recent analyst conference call the CEO of OceanFront announced plans to increase the firm’s retention ratio to fund several new acquisitions and development projects. Specifically, he explained that OceanFront recently acquired several vacant lots in a popular beach-front community following a zoning change which allows for construction of high-rise condominiums.\" Thus, OceanFront has recently acquired \"land held for future development\" and the transactions are recent. This combined with the fact that dividends are being lowered to begin development of these properties makes NAV the best choice for estimating OceanFront's intrinsic value. A is incorrect because \"applying a multiple to FFO or AFFO may not capture the intrinsic value of all real estate assets held by the REIT or REOC; for example, land parcels and empty buildings may not currently produce income and hence do not contribute to FFO (and AFFO) but have value”. C is incorrect because the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach is most appropriate and applicable when REITs and REOCs \"return a significant portion of their income to their investors.\" In this case, \"In a recent analyst conference call the CEO of OceanFront announced plans to significantly increase the firm’s retention ratio to fund several new acquisitions and development projects”. 8. If the client implements Rousseau’s recommendation, the number of gold futures contracts in his portfolio will most likely: A. decrease. B. stay the same. C. increase. Answer: AA is correct because \"gold futures are currently in contango\" and will require buying fewer contracts to meet Rousseau's goal of \"maintaining the same dollar exposure in gold futures.\" In the readings: \"A portfolio may require buying more far contracts than the near contracts being sold. Investors can observe this scenario if backwardation is driving the shape of the commodity futures price curve.\" In the opposite case, if the futures price curve shape is being driven by contango–with a higher futures price in the far contract–this scenario will require the purchase of fewer commodity contracts than in the near position. B is incorrect because \"gold futures are currently in contango\" and will require buying fewer contracts to meet Rousseau's goal of \"maintaining the same dollar exposure in gold futures.\" The number of required contracts would only remain the same if the price of the expiring near contract is equal to the price of the far contract the investor is rolling into.

      "Chunk 1: Sample Level II CFA Program Item-Set Questions TOPIC: ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS TOTAL POINT VALUE OF THIS QUESTION SET IS 12 POINTS Edgar Somer, CFA, was recently hired as a portfolio manager at Karibe Investment Management. Somer previously worked at a rival firm where he produced an average annual return of 11% using a small-cap value strategy. On his first day at Karibe, the firm asks Somer to approve marketing materials that present the following performance disclosures. • Text which states: “Somer has generated average annual returns of 11%” • The 3-year performance of a composite of Karibe client accounts that follow a similar small-cap value strategy • A disclosure that the assumptions and calculations underlying the returns presented are publicly available on Karibe’s public website To maintain relationships with clients and to attract prospective clients, Somer is active on social media. He posts a link to a news story about a famous athlete who recently paid substantial tax penalties after failing to properly report investment gains. In addition to the link Somer writes the comment: “A client of mine had similar gains, but because I kept proper records he faced no penalties. #HireAProfessional”. Some responses to the post suggest that readers mistakenly believe the athlete is Somer’s client. Somer does not post a clarifying comment. Somer develops a new quantitative investment strategy that he describes in marketing materials. The description states that “the strategy is based on eight proven fundamental and technical factors, including well-known factors such as value and momentum as well as certain proprietary factors that have been back-tested. The strategy includes a dynamic weighting component to adjust the amount allocated to each factor based on prevailing market conditions.” The materials also highlight risks such as “the possibility that the model or its underlying factors may not work out of sample,” and “because the weight placed on various factors is dynamic, it may not be suitable for clients who seek steady exposure to certain factors.” One of Somer’s clients agrees to use this strategy. When preparing the first performance report for this client, Somer discovers a coding error that reversed the client’s weightings assigned to the value and momentum factors. Prior to joining Karibe, Somer purchased shares in a small-cap technology firm for his personal portfolio. When he started his new role Somers disclosed the position, which had quadrupled in value since the initial purchase and represented more than 5% of his personal holdings. He hadno intention to sell the shares and he recommended them to clients at Karibe, to whom he disclosed his ownership. After the successful launch of a new product resulted in additional large gains in the shares, Somer now recommends that clients place limit orders when purchasing the shares. Though he remains bullish on the stock he is concerned about the size of his personal position, which is now more than 15% of his portfolio. One of his clients recently placed a limit order at $50 per share, which represents the highest bid in the market. The lowest offer is $52. Somer considers filling the client’s order with some of his own shares at the $50 bid price. 1. To best comply with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct (the Standards) related to performance presentation, Somer should modify the: A. text regarding Somer’s investment returns. B. presentation of the performance for Karibe’s representative composite. C. content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations. 2. Does Somer’s social media post result in a violation of the Standards? A. No. B. Yes, he violates the standard related to preservation of confidentiality. C. Yes, he violates the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients. 3. When preparing the marketing materials for the quantitative strategy, did Somer comply with the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients? A. Yes. B. No, because he did not identify the risk of coding errors. C. No, because he did not describe the investment process in detail. 4. If he fills the client’s order for shares of the technology firm, would Somer violate the standard related to priority of transactions? A. No. B. Yes, because the client would be disadvantaged by the trade. C. Yes, because he would benefit personally from a trade undertaken for a client.TOPIC: FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS TOTAL POINT VALUE OF THIS QUESTION SET IS 12 POINTS Paris Rousseau, a wealth manager at a US-based investment management firm, is meeting with a new client. The client has asked Rousseau to make recommendations regarding his portfolio’s exposure to liquid alternative investments, specifically publicly traded real estate investments and commodity futures. Publicly Traded Real Estate Rousseau believes that the client should increase his portfolio's allocation to publicly traded real estate through equity REITs. She collects financial information for the three office REITs presented in Exhibit 1. Exhibit 1 Chambon Autier REIT Bissorte REIT REIT Current market price per share ($) 161.58 137.86 42.20 Last 12-months net operating income (NOI in $ millions) 1,085.80 1,826.12 431.79 Last 12-months funds from operations (FFO in $ millions) 877.42 1,085.84 328.79 Cash and equivalents ($ millions) 80.38 140.63 4.25 Accounts receivable and prepaid/other assets ($ millions) 109.30 504.32 11.35 Non-cash (straight-line) rent adjustment ($ millions) 20.55 0.00 5.45 Recurring maintenance-type capital expenditures ($ millions) 54.52 75.85 8.75 Leasing costs & tenant improvement allowances ($ millions) 19.34 29.23 13.34 Total debt outstanding and other liabilities ($ millions) 7,049.29 12,236.03 2,222.97 Shares outstanding (millions) 115.15 154.62 146.76 Office sub-sector forecast 12-month growth in NOI and FFO 1.50% Office sub-sector average capitalization rate 5.75% Office sub-sector average P/FFO multiple 20x Rousseau computes adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share and net asset value per share (NAVPS) for each REIT in Exhibit 1. Rousseau also considers recommending OceanFront Partners, a condominium developer operating as a publicly-traded real estate operating company (REOC), for inclusion in the client’s portfolio. In a recent analyst conference call, the CEO of OceanFront announced plansto significantly increase the firm’s retention ratio to fund several new acquisitions and\n",
      "Chunk 2: development projects. Specifically, the CEO explained that OceanFront recently purchased several vacant lots in a popular beach-front community following a zoning change which allows for construction of high-rise condominiums. Commodity Futures Rousseau notes that the client’s portfolio currently has a futures position in gold. The client’s gold futures contracts are nearing expiration. Rousseau notes that gold futures are currently in contango, and she recommends rolling forward the client’s position while maintaining the same dollar exposure in gold futures. 5. The AFFO per share for Autier REIT over the last 12-months is closest to: A. $6.80. B. $7.16. C. $8.43. 6. The NAVPS for Bissorte REIT is closest to: A. $129.34. B. $130.43. C. $133.51. 7. The most appropriate method for estimating the intrinsic value of OceanFront is based on: A. P/AFFO. B. net asset value. C. discounted cash flow. 8. If the client implements Rousseau’s recommendation, the number of gold futures contracts in his portfolio will most likely: A. decrease. B. stay the same. C. increase.Answers to Sample Level II Item-Set Questions 1. To best comply with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct (the Standards) related to performance presentation, Somer should modify the: A. text regarding Somer’s investment returns. B. presentation of the performance for Karibe’s representative composite. C. content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations. Answer: A A is correct because Somer’s returns are not clearly explained as being generated at his prior firm. If a firm is not claiming GIPS compliance, “Members and candidates can also meet their obligations under Standard III(D) by including disclosures that fully explain the performance being reported.” B is incorrect because the marketing materials present the performance of a composite of similar portfolios. C is incorrect because the materials direct prospective clients to the website where a full disclosure of the assumptions and calculations are available 2. Does Somer’s social media post result in a violation of the Standards? A. No. B. Yes, he violates the standard related to preservation of confidentiality. C. Yes, he violates the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients. Answer: A A is correct because Somer did not reveal the identity of his client (Standard III(E)). The context of the comment (he helped his client avoid penalties) contradicts the mistaken conclusion of the readers of the social media post (the athlete in question had to pay penalties so obviously was not his client). He also does not violate the standard related to communication (Standard V(B)) because it applies to 1) disclosure of the format and general principles of the investment process; 2) significant limitations and risks of the investment process; 3) identifying important factors for their analysis and recommendations; and 4) distinguishing between fact and opinion in investment analyses and recommendations. His post did not relate to any of these and thus is not a potential violation of the standard. B is incorrect because Somer does not violate the standard related to confidentiality because the athlete in the news story is not his client, and the information that he helped his own clientavoid tax penalties by keeping good records does not provide enough information to disclose the client’s identity. C is incorrect because Somer does not violate the standard related to communication (Standard V(B)) because it applies to 1) disclosure of the format and general principles of the investment process; 2) significant limitations and risks of the investment process; 3) identifying important factors for their analysis and recommendations; and 4) distinguishing between fact and opinion in investment analyses and recommendations. His post did not relate to any of these and thus is not a potential violation of the standard, but certain candidates and/or exam team writers who think that communications with clients includes a duty to correct everyone who misunderstands you may choose this answer. 3. When preparing the marketing materials for the quantitative strategy, did Somer comply with the standard related to communication with clients and prospective clients? A. Yes. B. No, because he did not identify the risk of coding errors. C. No, because he did not describe the investment process in detail. Answer: A A is correct because he did not violate Standard V(B). With respect to informing clients of the investment process, the guidance stipulates that when explaining the process one “need not describe the investment system in detail… but must inform clients of (the) basic process and logic.” The explanation of Somer’s process as factor-based with weights dynamically allocated meets this criterion. Regarding risk identification, “members and candidates cannot be expected to disclose risks they are unaware of at the time…. Having no knowledge of a risk or limitation that subsequently triggers a loss may reveal a deficiency in the diligence and reasonable basis… but may not reveal a breach of Standard V(B).” B is incorrect because “members and candidates cannot be expected to disclose risks they are unaware of at the time…. Having no knowledge of a risk or limitation that subsequently triggers a loss may reveal a deficiency in the diligence and reasonable basis… but may not reveal a breach of Standard V(B).” C is incorrect because when explaining the process one “need not describe the investment system in detail… but must inform clients of (the) basic process and logic.” (Example 1 p. 141) The explanation of Somer’s process as factor-based with weights dynamically allocated meets this criterion. 4. If he fills the client’s order for shares of the technology firm, would Somer violate the standard related to priority of transactions? A. No.B. Yes, because the client would be disadvantaged by the trade. C. Yes, because he would benefit personally from a trade undertaken for a client. Answer: C C is correct because the guidance for Standard VI(B) specifies that “nothing is inherently unethical about… making money from personal investments as long as (1) the client is not disadvantaged by the trade, (2) the investment professional does not personally benefit from trades undertaken for clients, and (3) the investment professional complies with applicable regulatory requirements.”\n",
      "Chunk 3: In this case, Somer would personally benefit from a trade undertaken for a client by realizing a large gain and reducing the portfolio risk arising from his large position, which results in several potential conflicts of interest. At a minimum he would need to disclose to the client that he was filling the order from his own account and seek permission from Karibe to do so. A is incorrect because Somer would personally benefit from a trade undertaken for a client by realizing a large gain and reducing the portfolio risk arising from his large position, which results in several potential conflicts of interest. At a minimum he would need to disclose to the client that he was filling the order from his own account and seek permission from Karibe to do so. B is incorrect because the client is not disadvantaged by the trade (and in fact gets the order filled at a discount to the prevailing market price). 5. The AFFO per share for Autier REIT over the last 12-months is closest to: A. $6.80. B. $7.16. C. $8.43 Answer: A A is correct because \"AFFO is most often defined as FFO adjusted to remove any non-cash rent and to subtract maintenance-type capital expenditures and leasing costs (including leasing agent's commissions and tenants' improvement allowances)\" The computation for Autier REIT is as follows: Last 12-Months Funds From Operations (FFO) $877.42 million Less: Non-Cash Rents 20.55 million Less: Recurring CapEx (Maintenance) 54.52 million Less: Leasing Cost & Tenant Allowances 19.34 millionAdjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) $783.01 million To arrive at Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) per share, divide AFFO by the number of shares outstanding (115.15 million). Correct AFFO per share = $783.01 / 115.15 = $6.7999 ≈ $6.80 B is incorrect. In this case non-cash rents get added to FFO instead of subtracting them. C is incorrect. In this case the adjustments are added instead of subtracted. 6. The NAVPS for Bissorte REIT is closest to: A. $129.34. B. $130.43. C. $133.51. Answer: C C is correct because \"NAVPS is the difference between a real estate company’s assets and its liabilities, all taken at current market values instead of accounting book values, divided by the number of shares outstanding\" The Net Asset Value (NAV) for Bissorte REIT is correctly computed as: Net Operating Income (Last 12 Months) $1,826.12 million Less: Non-Cash Rents 0.00 million Times: (1+ Forecast growth in NOI) x 1.015 Estimated Next 12-Months Cash NOI $1,853.51 million Divide: Capitalization Rate / 0.0575 Estimated Value of Operating Real Estate $32,234.99 million Plus: Cash and Equivalents 140.63 million Plus: A/R and Prepaids/Other Assets 504.32 million Less: Total Debt & Other Liabilities 12,236.03 million Net Asset Value (NAV) $20,643.91 million The candidate then divides the NAV computed above by the number of shares Bissorte REIT has outstanding (154.62) to arrive at the correct NAVPS. Correct NAVPS = $20,643.91 / 154.62 = $133.51A is incorrect. In this case the current assets of \"Cash and Equivalents\" and \"Accounts Receivable and Prepaid/Other Assets\" in the computation of NAV are not added back. B is incorrect. In this case NAV is computed using the next 12-months forecast NOI, not last 12- months NOI as presented in the exhibit. 7. The most appropriate method for estimating the intrinsic value of OceanFront is based on: A. P/AFFO. B. net asset value. C. Discounted cash flow. Answer: B B is correct because net asset value (NAV) explicitly considers \"land held for future development\" and is not affected by changes in dividends. As noted in the case, \"In a recent analyst conference call the CEO of OceanFront announced plans to increase the firm’s retention ratio to fund several new acquisitions and development projects. Specifically, he explained that OceanFront recently acquired several vacant lots in a popular beach-front community following a zoning change which allows for construction of high-rise condominiums.\" Thus, OceanFront has recently acquired \"land held for future development\" and the transactions are recent. This combined with the fact that dividends are being lowered to begin development of these properties makes NAV the best choice for estimating OceanFront's intrinsic value. A is incorrect because \"applying a multiple to FFO or AFFO may not capture the intrinsic value of all real estate assets held by the REIT or REOC; for example, land parcels and empty buildings may not currently produce income and hence do not contribute to FFO (and AFFO) but have value”. C is incorrect because the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach is most appropriate and applicable when REITs and REOCs \"return a significant portion of their income to their investors.\" In this case, \"In a recent analyst conference call the CEO of OceanFront announced plans to significantly increase the firm’s retention ratio to fund several new acquisitions and development projects”. 8. If the client implements Rousseau’s recommendation, the number of gold futures contracts in his portfolio will most likely: A. decrease. B. stay the same. C. increase. Answer: AA is correct because \"gold futures are currently in contango\" and will require buying fewer contracts to meet Rousseau's goal of \"maintaining the same dollar exposure in gold futures.\" In the readings: \"A portfolio may require buying more far contracts than the near contracts being sold. Investors can observe this scenario if backwardation is driving the shape of the commodity futures price curve.\" In the opposite case, if the futures price curve shape is being driven by contango–with a higher futures price in the far contract–this scenario will require the purchase of fewer commodity contracts than in the near position. B is incorrect because \"gold futures are currently in contango\" and will require buying fewer contracts to meet Rousseau's goal of \"maintaining the same dollar exposure in gold futures.\" The number of required contracts would only remain the same if the price of the expiring near contract is equal to the price of the far contract the investor is rolling into.

However, predicting random shocks is not necessary because, by definition, random shocks are unpredictable and cannot be factored into time series coefficients. \\u2014 You Can Coach Jan 23, 2023 at 05:02\\nThis version of the question reflects the key points from the summary and accurately presents a choice that is not relevant to time-series modeling.

It quantifies the average magnitude of prediction error, with a lower RMSE value indicating a more accurate forecasting model.\\n\\nDetailed Video Answer\\n\\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a common measure of the differences between prediction (forecast) values and the actual observed values. It signifies the square root of the mean of the square of all the error values. In time-series forecasting, RMSE is one of the key metrics to compare the accuracies of different models and decide on their effectiveness in forecasting.\\n\\nOut of the options given:\\n\\nA) Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is a measure of the variability around an average or expected value, but it's not as commonly used as RMSE for assessing forecast accuracy.\\n\\nB) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a statistical method for fitting a model to data, not a measure for comparing forecast accuracy.\\n\\nC) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is indeed a widely used measure for assessing the accuracy of forecasts, making it the correct choice.\\n\\nD) Coefficient of Determination, also known as R-squared, tells us the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It is not specifically used to measure forecast error or accuracy.\\n\\nOn this basis, option C, Root Mean Squared Error, is the correct answer for the multiple-choice question developed from the summary provided about time-series analysis.\\n\\nTrue or False: The linear trend is suitable for time series that grow by a constant percentage over time.\\n\\nAnswer: False. A linear trend is suitable for data that increase or decrease by a consistent amount over time, while a log-linear model is chosen for time series that grow by a constant percentage over time.\\n\\nFill in the blank: A series is _______ if it has a constant mean and variance and a covariance that does not depend on time.\\n\\nAnswer: covariance stationary\"\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, we have developed a comprehensive system for retrieving relevant contexts from a Pinecone index and generating prompts for natural language processing tasks. The system leverages Pinecone's efficient indexing and nearest neighbor search capabilities to gather contextual information relevant to a given query. By incorporating these contexts into prompts, we enable more accurate and contextually relevant responses from language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieval process ensures that the generated prompts contain pertinent information to guide the model in generating appropriate responses. This approach enhances the quality and relevance of the generated text, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including question answering, summarization, and dialogue systems.\n",
