# Final Projects & Portfolio Work

## 📖 Overview
This directory contains resources, templates, and examples for the **INFO 7390 Final Projects**. It serves as a repository for end-to-end data science projects that demonstrate the complete lifecycle of a model from development and training to evaluation and deployment.

## 🔑 Key Components
This project requires demonstrating the full lifecycle of a data product:

* **Model Development:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, and training advanced models (often Deep Learning).
* **Deployment:** Moving the model beyond a notebook into a usable state (e.g., an API or web app).
* **Critical Analysis:** A unique requirement of this course is applying **"Computational Skepticism"**—rigorously questioning your own data and results to find bias, causality issues, or false correlations.

## 👥 Team & Submission Policy
* **Team Size:** The final project can be submitted as an **individual** or in a **team of up to 3 people**.
* **Grading Criteria:** Projects will be graded according to the strength and size of the team.
    * *Individual submissions* are evaluated on standard project requirements.
    * *Team submissions* are expected to demonstrate higher complexity, deeper analysis, and a broader scope proportionate to the number of members.
