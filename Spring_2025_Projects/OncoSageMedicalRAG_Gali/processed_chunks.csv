Introduction
A hundred years ago, cancer was not so common; however, 
since the last couple of decades, its incidence has been rising 
alarmingly , probably due to our changing lifestyle, habits, 
and increased life expectancy . Cancer is one of the most 
dreaded diseases of the 20 th century and spreading further 
with continuance and increasing incidence in the 21 st century . 
The situation is so alarming that every fourth person is 
having a lifetime risk of cancer. [1] India registers more than 
11 lakh new cases of cancer every year, whereas, this figure 
is above 14 million worldwide. We are constantly exposed 
to a variety of cancer causing agents, known as carcinogens.
What is cancer? Put simply; cancer is the abnormal growth",993
cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf_2,cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf,"What is cancer? Put simply; cancer is the abnormal growth 
of cells. Cancers arise from any organ or body structure and 
are composed of tiny cells that have lost the ability to stop 
growing. Occasionally , cancer may be detected “incidentally” by 
a laboratory test or radiological routine test or for an entirely 
different reason. In general, cancer must reach a size of 1 
cm, or be comprised of 1 million cells, before it is detected. 
At this point, it may be referred to as a “‘mass,” a “growth,” 
a “tumor,” a “nodule,” a “lump,” or a “lesion.” Exceptions 
to this general rule include cancers of the blood and bone 
marrow (leukemia’s and lymphomas) – which frequently do 
not produce a “mass,” but will be evident on laboratory tests.
Transformation of a normal cell into a cancerous cell is 
probably not such a critical event in the genesis of cancer; 
rather it is the inability of immune cells of the body to 
identify and destroy the newly formed cancer cells when",980
cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf_3,cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf,"identify and destroy the newly formed cancer cells when 
they are a few in numbers. [2] The risk of cancer is multiplied 
in those persons, whose immune system is suppressed due 
to any factor including chronic stress, old age, chronic 
debilitating disease, previous use of chemotherapy , and abuse 
of drugs such as analgesics, antibiotics, and corticosteroids.
Multidisciplinary Aspects
Cancer cells continue to grow unless one of four things 
occur:  (1) The cancerous mass is removed surgically; 
(2) using chemotherapy or another type of cancer -specific 
medication, such as hormonal therapy; (3) using radiation 
therapy; or (4) the cancer cells shrink and disappear on their 
own. This last event, while extremely rare, can occur with 
some melanomas or some kidney cancers.
Surgery , radiotherapy , and chemotherapy from the 
conventional approaches are used to treat cancer. Surgery 
was the first modality used successfully in the treatment of",955
cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf_4,cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf,"was the first modality used successfully in the treatment of 
cancer. It is the only curative therapy for many common 
solid tumors. The most important determinant of a successful 
surgical therapy is the absence of distant metastases and 
no local infiltration. Chemotherapy is the administration 
of cytotoxic agents (orally or intravenously , usually in 
combinations) resulting in cytotoxicity to both resting and 
dividing cells. The objective of cancer chemotherapy is to 
prevent cancer cells from multiplying, invading, metastasizing, 
and killing the patient. Systemic chemotherapy is the main 
treatment available for disseminated malignant diseases. 
Radiation therapy is a local modality used in the treatment of 
cancer. Other conventional techniques used in the treatment 
of cancer including bone marrow transplantation, peripheral 
stem cell transplantation, hormone therapy , photodynamic 
therapy , cryosurgery , immunotherapy , and gene therapy .",965
cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf_5,cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf,"therapy , cryosurgery , immunotherapy , and gene therapy .
Is cancer curable? The short answer to this question is “Y es.” In 
fact, all cancers are curable if they are caught early enough. That 
is the justification for screening tests (such as mammograms, 
colonoscopies, and Pap smear examination). When cancers are 
caught early , they tend to be smaller; they are thus either easier 
to remove surgically or more likely to shrink in response to 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy . When cancer is localized, it 
can be totally removed by surgery but in most of the cases, it 
is practically impossible to detect cancer at such an early stage. 
Early detection is often the key to surviving any form of cancer.
The diagnosis and treatment of cancer have come a long way 
in the last 50 years. In the past, cancer, the “C-word,” was a 
death sentence. Today , we can treat and cure several types of 
cancer; however, it is evident that these cancers need to be",963

many cases of leukemia can all be cured in adults with current 
treatments. Most skin cancers are cured with surgery . Moreover, 
many cases of thyroid cancer and cancer of the larynx are cured 
with radiotherapy . Many other types of cancer are also cured 
if they are found early enough  – for example, 75% of breast 
cancers found at an early stage. Of course, there is still a long 
way to go before we can cure most cancers. The difficulty is 
that different cancers are caused by different things, so there 
is not one strategy that can prevent them. They also respond 
to different treatments, so not one kind of treatment can cure 
them all. Even though we can cure several types of cancers, it 
is important to maintain vigilance about screening for cancer.
Some forms of cancer are curable no matter when they 
are detected, and some are only curable if they are caught",984
cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf_8,cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf,"are detected, and some are only curable if they are caught 
at any early stage. For example, acute leukemia and some 
types of lymphoma can be curable with chemotherapy . 
Certain lymphomas such as Hodgkin’s disease require 
radiation therapy for a cure. Other common cancers such 
as colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, 
and pancreatic cancer are all curable, but only if they are 
detected in early stages (Stage I or II).
Some cancers have high survival rates with early detection. 
Six highly treatable cancers among others are – cancers of 
breast, skin (nonmelanomas), colon, prostate, testes, and 
cervix. Most of the childhood malignancies (both solid and 
hematolymphoid) are curable.
Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among 
women, as one out of every eight women will be diagnosed 
in her lifetime. In patients whose breast cancer is detected 
while still in localized form have a 5-year survival rate of",952
cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf_9,cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf,"while still in localized form have a 5-year survival rate of 
98%, compared with a survival rate of 72% by Stage III 
and just 22% by Stage IV . [3,4]
Skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell 
carcinoma) are the most common form of all human cancers, 
and if found early , skin cancer is nearly 100% treatable. 
Likewise, diagnosing cervical cancer while the lesions are 
precancerous leads to a near 100% survival rate, but the 
rate drops to just 32% if diagnosed in Stage III and 16% if 
diagnosed at Stage IV . Testicular cancer is treatable in 99% 
of the time when detected early , but only 73% are cancer-free 
after 5 years if diagnosed in advanced stages. Similarly , 5-year 
survival rate when colon cancer is detected early is 90%, yet 
only 39% of cases are diagnosed before cancer has begun to 
spread. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology , and End 
Results Program, it is 98% survivable for 5 or more years",940
cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf_10,cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf,"Results Program, it is 98% survivable for 5 or more years 
if prostate cancer diagnosed at stages when the disease is 
confined to the prostate gland (Stage I and II).[1] The survival 
rate drops to about 28% if diagnosed at Stage IV .
Cancers cells not only have mutations that result in 
dysregulated expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor 
genes, but these changes result in the alteration of expression 
of hundreds of genes. Looking at this, we have various forms 
of “targeted” therapy directed at specific single molecular 
targets or a class of molecular targets in cancer cells. With 
targeted therapy , the specific mechanism of action of the drug 
results in an increase in its therapeutic index. Currently , the 
two major classes of targeted therapy are the small molecule 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (MABs). 
Imatinib, for instance, has been amazingly successful as a 
targeted agent directed against several members of a class of",976
cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf_11,cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf,"targeted agent directed against several members of a class of 
enzyme known as tyrosine kinases, and by that mechanism, 
it has been phenomenally successful as a treatment of chronic 
myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. 
Tamoxifen is a targeted therapy directed at the estrogen 
receptor (ER), and it still remains a mainstay of treatment for 
ER-positive breast cancers, along with a newer class of drugs 
known as aromatase inhibitors.
Cancer researchers work on developing new and more 
effective surgery techniques, radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
drugs all the time. Biological therapies such as MABs, 
cancer vaccines, and gene therapies are all active areas of 
research. There are various anti-angiogenic drugs that can 
stop cancers from growing the blood vessels that they need. 
Research is also looking into developing cost-effective ways 
of screening for the different common cancers so they can 
be diagnosed early enough to be cured.",966
cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf_12,cancer_and_cure__a_critical_analysis.27.pdf,"of screening for the different common cancers so they can 
be diagnosed early enough to be cured.
Avoiding immune destruction is now considered a hallmark 
of cancer, and the immunotherapy arena has exploded 
with the recent advances demonstrating an improvement 
in survival and a durability of response in patients with 
different cancer types, like in melanoma, which translates 
into an improved overall survival benefit. [5] To name those 
immunotherapeutic strategies that include the adoptive 
transfer of ex vivo activated T cells, immunomodulatory 
MABs, and cancer vaccines. Advances in molecular 
pathology will provide the means to identify the targets 
and will be used to subtype tumors and will provide predict 
response to therapy and provide prognostic information. [6]
Conclusion
Unfortunately , although we do fairly well (and in some cases 
very well) against early stage cancer, we do not do so well 
against Stage IV metastatic disease, particularly solid tumors.",985

INTRODUCTION: 
Welcome to the Department of Medical Oncology at the Townsville Cancer Centre. By 
the end of the term, you should be able to identify and manage common side effects of 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the areas of general practice, emergency departments 
and rural hospitals and general medical wards. You will also have some understanding of 
treatment principles and aims of cancer therapy for common malignancies. This 
handbook is meant for the use of resident medical officers and basic physician trainees. 
It may also be useful to advanced trainees in the ir first few months of training. We hope 
that this experience will give you the skills to deal with cancer patients with positive and 
empathetic approach. 
If you are encountering emotional difficulties when dealing with poor prognosis, please 
talk to one of us earlier in the term to learn ways to deal with it effectively. 
 
Enjoy the medical oncology rotation.

ORIENTATION TO MEDICAL ONCOLOGY DEPARTMENT 
Junior medical officers play an important role in the day-to-day care of patients in 
Medical Oncology Department . It is critical that you work in c lose collaboration with 
senior medical, nursing and allied health staff , along with our administrative support 
officers.  
We have outlined some useful practice points will help you to settle into our department 
smoothly. 
Educational and training resources 
Electronic medical records 
Townsville Cancer Centre uses MOSAIQ as its EMR. Please become familiar with 
MOSAIQ by contacting the CNC for MOSAIQ on 32888 or through  our administrative 
support officers 44331671 prior to commencement. We assume that you are familiar with 
the ieMR, the THHS-wide EMR. 
Chemotherapy protocol 
eviQ is a very useful website to learn chemotherapy protocols and side -effects. It also 
contains information about managing extravasation (www.eviq.org.au).",947
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_6,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"contains information about managing extravasation (www.eviq.org.au). 
NB: RMOs and interns are not expected to write chemotherapy orders. When 
writing oral chemotherapy, targeted agents and colony stimulating factors, please 
exercise caution and follow the advice of your registrars and consultants.  
Medication prescribing 
Quality of inpatient medication prescribing can be improved by adhering to the THHS 
guide for inpatient medication prescription. 
End of life care bedside tutorial and introduction to telehealth 
These two topics are available on YouTube (searchable using the titles) and are useful 
resources for developing mental frameworks for approaching these topics. 
Basic principles of oncology 
Clinical oncology for medical students is a useful resource for learning basic principles 
of oncology care.

Documentation 
Since funding for operations of medical departments are linked to their clinical activities, 
it is important to use coding terminologies during documentation of patient notes. 
Issues with central venous access devices  
We use central lines commonly in oncology and therefore, it is prudent to be aware of 
managing complications. As a rule, when it is difficult to draw blood from lines or inject 
fluids, it is important to use imaging (including chest -Xray and linogram) for checking 
the position and viability before using the lines. Please seek advice when infection and 
thrombosis are suspected/proven. We can rarely save lines using antibiotics  
Self-care 
Please maintain physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health. Take  regular breaks as 
much as possible and maintain effective work -life balance (This doesn’t mean work is 
bad and life is good; it is about having a balance that suits your needs) . Please seek help",960
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_8,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"bad and life is good; it is about having a balance that suits your needs) . Please seek help 
if you think you need help including emotional support and guidance. 
Day unit 
• Orientate with the Day-unit staff and introduce yourself to senior nursing 
staff and establish working relationships with them.   
• You are the first point of call for any issues in day unit and therefore, please 
make sure that you are always available during rostered hours. Day unit relies 
on effective discharge of patients to maintain flow. A delay due to one issue 
could delay the whole day’s operation and care of other patients. 
• Infusion reactions are medical emergencies: You should always attend to a 
patient having a reaction, leaving everything else. If you are not available, 
please make sure another doctor can attend the patient immediately. 
Clinics 
• Being “On Time” is important! Clinics start on time so that patients can 
receive their chemotherapy in day unit without delays.",982
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_9,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"receive their chemotherapy in day unit without delays. 
• If a patient is seen by the consultant in clinic, please ask them to sign the blue 
form. 
Dealing with consultants and registrars 
Please don’t hesitate to seek help from senior medical staff. All changes in management 
should be discussed. Harass them even if they are busy!",334
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_10,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"5 
 
Dealing with nurses and other health professionals 
• Advice from nursing staff is an important resource for patient care.  
• When chemotherapy changes, delays or cancellation occur, it is prudent to 
inform the nursing and pharmacy staff. 
Dealing with patients on chemotherapy and chemotherapy orders 
• When you see a patient for chemotherapy review, please prepare the care 
plans for the next cycle. 
• Dose reduction: After consultation with senior medical staff, please document 
dose reductions and make changes on MOSAIQ scripts. If there is a dose 
increase, it is possible only from the next cycle. 
• All chemotherapy bookings are done through administration officers and day 
unit schedulers. 
• Initial chemotherapy orders should be counter-signed by a consultant. 
• Please be familiar with important practice points for common medications as 
described in this hand book. 
Admitted patients 
• Make sure they are seen by consultants within 24 hours of admission and on a",992

regular basis; 
• Have an expected date of discharge and do the discharge planning, including 
timely completion of high-quality discharge summaries; ideally on the day 
of discharge, using the national guide for discharge summaries. 
• If a patient undergoing chemotherapy is admitted with complications, inform 
the day-unit and the treating consultant of any changes in treatment. It will 
also be important to document this episode on MOSAIQ for continuity of 
care and future planning including dose changes and addition of GCSF. 
• If any oncology patient is admitted in another department or another hospital 
with complications, inform the treating consultant and document on 
MOSAIQ. 
• In-patient consults from other departments need to be seen on the same day, 
discussed with or seen by the consultant on call and documented on

PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS ON 
SYSTEMIC THERAPY 
Assessing fitness for systemic therapy 
Fitness for systemic therapy depends on many factors: 
• performance status, 
• the type and severity of side effects from previous cycles or doses, 
• blood parameters, 
• co-morbidities and 
• Patient choice 
If cure is the aim, it is usual to accept mild -to-moderate, non-life-threatening toxicities 
and continue treatment without delaying or reducing the dosage to minimise side effects. 
Sometimes it is prudent to use supportive therapy such as  G-CSF to maintain  dose 
intensity. However, in patients with incurable metastatic disease where quality of life is 
paramount, dose delays or dose reductions are necessary. 
Performance status 
This is graded using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. 
 
Grade ECOG performance status 
0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without 
restriction.",943
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_19,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without 
restriction. 
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to 
carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, 
office work 
2 Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any 
work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours 
3 Capable of only limited selfcare, confined to bed or chair more than 
50% of waking hours 
4 Completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined 
to bed or chair 
 
Usually, patients with ECOG grade > 2 are not fit for chemotherapy. The exception is 
chemotherapy-sensitive cancers such as lymphoma and small cell lung cancers. The 
decision to offer chemotherapy must be individualised , depending upon factors such as 
age of the patient, & comorbidities. For example, a young patient with metastatic breast",902
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_20,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"10 
 
cancer with poor performance status could still be offered systemic treatments. Targeted 
agents and endocrine therapy are usually tolerated better than chemotherapy. 
 
Toxicity from previous cycles of systemic therapy 
Clinicians must assess whether a side effect is affecting QOL, performance status  or is 
life threatening: 
First, determine the type and severity of side effects. 
For example, in patients with early breast cancers undergoing taxane chemotherapy, mild 
peripheral neuropathy is acceptable. However, in patients undergoing fluorouracil-based 
therapy, ongoing or severe diarrhoea necessitates a dose  delay and dose reduction of 
subsequent cycles. 
Mid-cycle neutropenic fever usually requires dose reduction of the subsequent cycle 
unless the cancer is curable. If the cancer is curable or a substantial duration of remission 
is expected, prophylactic colo ny stimulating factors such as pegfilgrastim (neulasta)",944
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_21,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"is expected, prophylactic colo ny stimulating factors such as pegfilgrastim (neulasta) 
and/or antibiotics can reduce the risk of subsequent and opportunistic infections. 
 
Next, determine the effects on important organs, such as: 
• Fertility. Discuss semen cryopreservation with men. Options for women 
should also be discussed, particularly in young women of child-bearing 
potential and where curative intention treatment is planned.  Options include 
preservation of egg, embryo and a piece of ovary is offered by some fertility 
groups. Women who wish to discuss this option should be referred to a 
fertility specialist. 
• Renal function, liver functions. 
• Cardiac function. This may affect the dosage of anthracyclines (check 
ejection fraction before treatment begins and after every 2–3 cycles) and 
trastuzumab (check ejection fraction before treatment begins and every 3 
months during therapy). 
Toxicity is graded according to NCI common terminology criteria for adverse events1.",997

For most regimens, a neutrophil count >1.5 x 109/L and platelet count > 100 x 
109/L are needed for safe administration of chemotherapy. For some regimens, 
lower levels may be acceptable. 
Single agent bleomycin and vincristine  are not myelotoxic and administration is 
not affected by blood counts. 
Renal function is important for cisplatin and carboplatin and liver function for 
docetaxel, Magnesium levels especially for cisplatin  and Calcium levels for

Symptom control 
Discussion or shared care with palliative care is helpful. However, basic principles are as 
follows: 
(Also refer to the Guide for inpatient medication prescription) 
1. Pain:    Always find out the cause of the pain before prescribing analgesics. 
Total daily morphine requirement will guide the required daily slow release dose. 
When prescribing breakthrough, the dose is 1/6th of the daily dose. So, if you are 
increasing the daily dose, breakthrough needs to increase as well. If oral intake is 
difficult—patches or infusional morphine are options. 
4. Dyspnoea:    Again, find out the cause, for cancer related dyspnoea—nebulised 
morphine and anxiolytics could be helpful. 
When to stop cancer treatment 
A decision to stop treatment prematurely depends on the aim of the treatment. 
For curable cancers, it is acceptable to continue treatment with dose modifications. 
However, life threatening or severe dose  limiting toxicities usually necessitate cessation",994
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_26,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"However, life threatening or severe dose  limiting toxicities usually necessitate cessation 
of treatment (eg. moderate to severe peripheral neuropathy with taxanes and oxaliplatin, 
severe enteritis from fluorouracil). Alternative regimens are sometimes available. 
If the cancer is incurable and th e toxicities severely interfere with the activities of daily 
living, treatment may have to be stopped. 
Deteriorating performance status and organ function usually require cessation of 
treatment. Ongoing neutropenia or thrombocytopenia typically means the p atient is not 
going to handle further chemotherapy. 
In case of patients with metastatic disease, palliative care team referral is done even when 
they are on active treatment, to improve symptom management and supportive care.",789

Chemotherapy related emesis 
Causes of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy: 
• Chemotherapy related. 
• Other causes such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or medications 
related. 
Pathways by which chemotherapeutic agents may produce an emetic 
response 2 
 
 
Chemotherapy-induced emesis results from stimulation of a multistep reflex pathway that 
is controlled by the brain and triggered by afferent impulses to the vomiting centre from 
the chemoreceptor trigger zone, gastrointestinal tract (by way of vagal affere nt fibres), 
and possibly, the cerebral cortex.

PRINCIPLES OF CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY 
 
 
 
(CTLA4 outcompetes CD28 for CD80 and CD86, and the costimulatory signal ceases as 
the target is eliminated, reducing the release of pro -effector cytokines such as IL-12 and 
cytotoxic enzymes such as perforin and granzyme B. Homeostasis is restored.) 
 
In a state of chronic antigen presentation, such as malignancy, the chronic presence of 
antigen or pro -inflammatory cytokines (IL -12, IFN  gamma, etc) can upregulate PD -1 
expression on the T cell; tumour clones can also select for PD-L1 expression. With PD-
1-PD-L1 binding, even in the presence of the costimulatory molecule, ""peripheral 
exhaustion"" can occur. 
 
 
 
 
The anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor to be 
approved based upon its ability to prolong survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.

Immune Response Criteria : The patt erns of response to treatment with these 
immunotherapy agents differ from those with molecularly -targeted agents or cytotoxic 
chemotherapy in several important respects. 
Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy 
Checkpoint inhibition is  associated with a unique spectrum of side effects termed 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs) or, occasionally, adv erse events of special 
interest. IrAEs include dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, and other less 
common inflammatory events4. 
In general, treatment of moderate or severe irAEs requires interruption of the checkpoint 
inhibitor and the use of corticosteroid immunosuppression. Treatment is based upon the 
severity of the observed toxicity: 
• For patients with grade 2 (moderate) immune-mediated toxicities, treatment",960
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_43,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"• For patients with grade 2 (moderate) immune-mediated toxicities, treatment 
with the checkpoint inhibitor should be withheld and should not be resumed 
until symptoms or toxicity is grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids should be started 
if symptoms do not resolve quickly. 
• For patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) immune-
mediated toxicities, treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor should be 
permanently discontinued. High doses of corticosteroids (prednisone 1 to 2 
mg/kg/day or equivalent) should be given. When symptoms subside to grade 
1 or less, steroids can be gradually tapered over at least one month. 
• Patients who will benefit from corticosteroids generally do so within days. If 
symptoms do not clearly improve, particularly after approximately three days 
with intravenous steroids, our approach is to administer infliximab (5 mg/kg) 
rather than continue with a prolonged course of high-dose IV corticosteroids.",960
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_44,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"rather than continue with a prolonged course of high-dose IV corticosteroids. 
If symptoms persist after the first infliximab dose, a second dose of 
infliximab (5 mg/kg) can be repeated two weeks after the initial dose.

SUMMARY OF MANAGEMENT OF COMMON CANCERS 15 16 
This section outlines the principles behind the management of common cancers. 
For metastatic cancers, enrolment into a clinical trial is the best treatment option. 
Summaries provided below are developed using eviQ and NCCN guidelines as practical 
guidance. 
 
 
BREAST CANCER 
Early breast cancers: 
(Includes axillary node positive disease.) 
• Mostly curative intent therapy. 
Post-operative systemic treatment depends on oestr ogen and/ or progestogen 
receptor status, Her 2 status and the estimated risk of systemic relapse. 
• Prognostic factors. 
Size, age, grade, axillary nodes, receptor status and lympho-vascular invasion. 
 
 Low risk Average risk High risk 
Size <1cm 1-2 cm >2 cm 
Age   <35 
Nodes Negative  Positive 
Grade Grade 1 Grade2 Grade3 
ER/PR Positive  Negative 
Her2 Negative  Positive 
LVI Absent present  
 
• Low risk - Hormonal manipulation or nil.",933

 Chemotherapy for ER/PR negative disease. 
• High risk- Chemotherapy + hormonal manipulation for ER positive disease. 
Chemotherapy for ER/PR negative disease. 
• For Her-2 positive disease, Herceptin is given with chemotherapy for total of 
52 weeks (3 weekly). 
• Hormonal manipulation-  
In premenopausal women; Tamoxifen alone may be an option . In patients who 
remain premenopausal after che motherapy and have high risk disease , ovarian 
suppression with LHRH agonists or bilateral oophorectom y with exemestane or 
Tamoxifen is better than Tamoxifen alone.  Aromatase Inhibitors are not used 
alone in premenopausal women.  
Consider 10 years of tamoxifen over 5 years of treatment, particularly for patients 
at highest baseline risk eg where chemotherapy was indicated. 
In post-menopausal women  - Aromatase inhibitors are the preferred endocrine 
treatment unless contraindicated. In patients who cannot tolerate AI or where it is 
contraindicated, Tamoxifen is used.",986
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_65,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"contraindicated, Tamoxifen is used.  
In post-menopausal patients who start treatment with tamoxifen, switching to AI 
after 2-3 years is recommended. 
5-10 additional years of aromatase inhibitors after 5 years of tamoxifen improves 
survival in high-risk patients.  
For patients on AIs and documented osteopaenia addition of bisphosphonates  
decreases the risk of decline in bone density.  They are also encouraged to take 
regular calcium and vitamin D tablets.  DEXA scans are done yearly to two yearly 
for monitoring bone health in patients on aromatase inhibitors. 
Chemotherapy regimens- 
• Lower risk/Average risk- 4x TC,  
• High risk- 3x FEC- 3x D OR AC-weekly Taxol OR AC- dd Taxol. AC may 
be given in dose dense fashion (preferred if possible). 
• In Her-2 positive disease, Trastuzumab is combined with Taxanes and not 
with anthracyclines because of risk of cardiac toxicity. Eg FEC-D Herceptin 
or AC-Taxol Trastuzumab.  Pertuzumab may be added in treatment given 
neoadjuvantly.",998

neoadjuvantly. 
• In Her2 positive disease, a non-anthracycline regimen, eg TCarboH is an  
alternative.17

• G-CSF prophylaxis- If severe neutropenia, cycles delayed because of 
neutropenia or complicated by neutropenic fever, add neulasta (most of these 
protocols now have upfront G-CSF)   
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: 
• Chemotherapy regimens are similar to adjuvant regimens.  
• More effective in triple negative or Her-2 positive disease. 
• May be used to achieve breast conservation in some cases, large primary 
tumour sizes, clinical nodal involvement (locally advanced disease) or if 
surgical concerns for upfront surgery. 
• Patients with residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy may require 
further chemotherapy treatment or a change in agent (eg capecitabine if triple 
negative, TDMI (trastuzumab emtansine) if HER2 positive). 
Post-operative radiotherapy: 
• After lumpectomy, radiotherapy decreases local recurrence rates. 
• After mastectomy, indications include (but not limited to): 
o close or positive margins 
o >/=4 axillary nodes involved 
o tumour size >5 cm",989

o >/=4 axillary nodes involved 
o tumour size >5 cm 
• Extensive lymphovascular invasion.  
Radiotherapy is given after the chemotherapy is completed, but can occur 
concurrently with Herceptin in Her2 positive disease 
Locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancers 
• The cure rate is lower than with early breast cancers. 
• Chemotherapy is given before surgery to reduce the size of the primary and 
eradicate micrometastases (see above for regimens). 
• Radiotherapy is given after surgery. 
Metastatic breast cancer 
• First line ER/PR+ HER2 - bone only metastases- Endocrine therapy +/- CDK 
4/6 inhibitor (eg palbociclib or ribociclib). 
• Patients with bone metastases also benefit from monthly Bisphosphonates or 
Denosumab to reduce pain, skeletal events and hypercalcemia. 
• First line chemotherapy is usually Taxane or Anthracycline based (depending 
upon chemotherapy exposure in adjuvant setting) with combination therapies",970

generally reserved for patients with high volume disease (including visceral 
disease) or suggestion of aggressive clinical course. 
Later lines of therapy can include taxanes, gemcitabine, capecitabine, 
vinorelbine and eribulin.  Choices may be influenced by patient and physician 
preferences, previous chemotherapy exposure and patient fitness.  For further 
detailed information on these protocols, visit eviQ website.  
• In Her 2 positive disease, Taxanes can be combined with Trastuzumab and 
Pertuzumab as initial treatment.  
Second line treatment may include TDM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine). If 
progression on TDM-1, use Lapatanib/capecitabine and Herceptin/ 
chemotherapy.",688

Cancers of the Gastro-Intestinal Tract 
Anal Cancer 
 
Majority of patients are treated with concurrent chemo-radiation. This requires PICC 
insertion and CADD pump for delivery of continuous infusion 5- Fluorouracil. 
 
Regimen:  
Mitomycin C on Day 1 and 5-Fluorouracil on Days 1 to 4 and 29 to 32 along 
with radiation for 5-6 weeks (standard of care). 
 
Mitomycin C can be substituted with Cisplatin (if patient has hypersensitivity to 
mitomycin or has any coagulation or bleeding disorders or thrombocytopenia). 
If patient cannot have PICC for some reason 5-Fluorouracil can be substituted 
with Capecitabine.  
 
Metastatic Anal Cancer: Different chemotherapies can be used such as, 
Carboplatin & Paclitaxel (weekly/three weekly), 5Fu & Cisplatin, FOLCIS 
(5Fu, leucovorin & Cisplatin), mFOLFOX, mDCF.

CERS OF THE GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRAC 
Biliary and Gall Bladder  
Outcome is usually poor in patients with multiple co -morbidities and poor performance 
status. In these cases, omitting chemotherapy from management plans may be prudent. 
• Adjuvant therapy for node positive disease– fluoropyrimidine or Gemcitabine 
based chemotherapy (eg: Cisplatin or Carboplatin/Gemcitabine). 
Consider chemoradiation for margin-positive or node positive cancer. 
• Metastatic/inoperable – Same regimens as adjuvant therapy. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma  
• Limited disease: Operable or locoregional therapy available 
• Inoperable or not suitable for locoregional therapy: Lenvatinib or Sorafenib 
in Child-Pugh A patients). Role of systemic chemotherapy is not established.

      Everolimus or sunitinib can be used for pancreatic Grade I/II tumours. 
• Grade III – Carboplatin and etoposide or cisplatin and etoposide.  
Adeno-carcinoma of Pancreas  
Role of neoadjuvant therapy continues to evolve, and this is usually not standard practice 
outside of clinical trial settings except where an MDT strongly recommends this 
approach. Outcome is usually poor in patients with multiple co -morbidities and poor 
performance status. In these cases, omitting chemotherapy from management plans may 
be prudent. 
 
• Adjuvant – modified FOLFORINOX x 6 months or Capecitabine + 
Gemcitabine. 
• Advanced/metastatic – If disease recurrence occurs after 6 months of 
completing adjuvant therapy, same regimen could be considered. In good 
performance patients with minimal co-morbidities, m FOLFIRINOX or 
Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel. After 4-6 months, less intensive components",988

In poor performance patients, BSC alone or single agent regimens such as 
gemcitabine may be appropriate. 
 
 
 Colon Cancer  
Stage I and II surgery alone.  
Stage II with adverse features is treated as stage III with adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Adverse features are – poorly differentiated histology, lympho-vascular invasion, 
bowel obstruction, perforation, fewer than 12 lymph nodes in the resected 
specimen, perineural invasion, close or positive margins. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy is for six months. However, in low risk patients (T1-3 
N1) shorter duration (three months) of adjuvant XELOX (CAPOX) is equivalent 
to six months of XELOX in efficacy with less neurotoxicity. If using mFOLFOX 
recommendation is for six months of treatment. For High risk features, 
recommendation is for six months of treatment. 
Regimens: Different schedules of calcium leucovorin and 5 fluorouracil, 
Capecitabine, FOLFOX & XELOX.",921
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_76,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"Capecitabine, FOLFOX & XELOX. 
Metastatic cancer: Any adjuvant regimen can be used in metastatic setting. Other 
regimens are Irinotecan, FOLFIRI, FOLFOXIRI, XELIRI. 
Assess patients with imaging after 3 cycles of chemotherapy for respectability of 
lesions. Discuss in GI multi-disciplinary meetings. Some of the patients with few 
metastases may eventually be curable.  
Bevacizumab is usually combined to different chemotherapy regimens in 
metastatic setting unless contra-indicated. 
Patients with KRAS wild type tumours have additional option of having 
Cetuximab/Panitumumab added to chemotherapy regimen. 
 
Rectal Cancer 
Most of the patients are treated with neo-adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. 
Chemotherapy consists of continuous infusion 5 -Fluorouracil through PICC line or oral 
capecitabine. If the patient did not receive neo -adjuvant treatment it may be given post -
operatively for T3/T4 or node positive tumours.",941

For those who had neo-adjuvant treatment further adjuvant chemotherapy is offered post-
operatively in the form of leucovorin-5-Fluorouracil/capecitabine to complete six months 
of perioperative chemotherapy. 
FOLFOX is currently not approved for rectal cancer. 
 
Metastatic rectal cancer 
All the regimens used in colonic cancer can be used in metastatic rectal cancer including

GBM 
• Surgery is for resectable disease. 
• For resected GBM, Temazolamide with RT and 4 weeks later, 5days per 
month for 6 months of Temazolamide improves survival.  
Temazolamide: 
• With RT- 75mg/m2/day M-F. 
• After RT or on its own for palliation- 150-200 mg/m2/day for 5 days a

Patients who are unfit for surgery can be given neo adjuvant chemotherapy first 
and receive surgery after several cycles of chemotherapy (interval debulking) with 
subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy.  This approach may reduce surgical morbidity 
of debulking procedures without compromising outcomes. 
Intraperitoneal chemotherapy may be used in selected stage3 disease, after 
optimal debulking surgery.

CANCERS OF GENITO URINARY SYSTEM 
PROSTATE CANCER 
Treatment depends on disease stage and hormone sensitivity. 
 
• Early stage disease is treated with surgery, radiotherapy (external beam and/ 
or brachytherapy) or observation. Treatment modality is individualised based 
on several factors: age and co morbidities of the patient, serum PSA level, 
Gleeson score, clinical stage and patient preference based on benefits and 
side effects of therapy. 
For example, a patient with clinically non apparent tumour with Gleason score of 
<6 who has a life expectancy of <10 years could be actively observed without any 
impact on survival. 
For locally advanced inoperable disease, radical radiotherapy cou ld lead to cure. 
Androgen deprivation therapy is sometimes used for short periods  (4-6 months) 
before/concomitantly/ after radiotherapy in selected high-risk patients.  
 
Metastatic disease is incurable and the aims are to prolong survival and improve 
quality of life.",982
medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf_93,medical_oncology_handbook_june_2020_edition.pdf,"quality of life. 
 
Hormone Sensitive disease: 
• All Hormone sensitive tumours are treated with a GnRH agonist (eg- 
goserelin, leuprorelin). To prevent flare, antiandrogens (eg- flutamide, are 
started 1-2 weeks before the injection and continued for a total of 3-4 weeks). 
Whether anti- androgens are continued beyond that is controversial.  
• Chemotherapy with Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 x 6 doses, can be added to 
hormonal therapy in fit patients with high volume (presence of visceral mets 
or >= 4 bony mets) metastatic disease, as it improves survival significantly 
(CHAARTED, STAMPEDE trials). 
Hormone Refractory disease: 
• Hormone refractory disease includes patients where the disease has 
progressed despite hormonal manipulation.  GnRH agonists are usually 
continued.   
• Chemotherapy improves median survival by up to 3 months and maintains 
improvement in quality of life.  
• Bone metastases are treated with intravenous bisphosphonates (eg-zoledronic",967

low volume disease, chemotherapy is usually delayed.",204

• Symptomatic metastases or rapid rise in PSA (doubling time of <3 months) 
may be treated with docetaxel (75mg/m2) and prednisone 5 mg BD. On 
progression after docetaxel, newer androgen inhibitors (below) are effective. 
Palliative care is another option. 
• Localised bone pain responds to external beam radiotherapy very well. Men 
with multifocal painful bone metastases and those with persistent or recurrent 
pain despite receiving EBRT to maximal normal tissue tolerance may achieve 
palliation of their symptoms by treatment with bone-targeted radioisotopes 
such as strontium-89. 
Disease progression after chemotherapy : Abiraterone , an andr ogen biosynthesis 
inhibitor or Enzalutamide an androgen receptor signalling inhibitor are effective. Median 
progression free survival and overall survival are better compared to placebo.

Sorefenib can also be used for papillary carcinoma. Everolimus and axitinib

• Intermediate and high-risk disease is treated with combination 
immunotherapy Ipilimumab (anti CTLA4) and Nivolumab (anti PDL-1).
