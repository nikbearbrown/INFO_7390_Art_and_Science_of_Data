        "about": "The Loring-Greenough House will celebrate the completion of our Native Plant Border at an unveiling in May. Join us to tour the garden, support the project by 'sponsoring' a plant, and learn about the benefits of Native Plants! The bed along the south-facing border contains a robust variety of plants that are native to the eastern half of the US, bringing color, visual interest, and seasonal changes to an existing plant bed. Mostly shade-loving, this mix of perennials and shrubs, along with evergreen trees for screening, will help the public identify and become more familiar with native plants that play an important ecological role in our community. Native plants are beneficial because they are low-maintenance, require less water, and provide habitat for birds and beneficial insects. Bleeding Heart, Jacob's Ladder, and Goldenrod are just a few of the many perennials that will greet all creatures, great and small, throughout the seasons. Recently added to the border are a few trees - the beautiful Fringe tree and three Arborvitaes. Among the shrubs are Aronia, Clethra and Sweetspire. Join us on May 10th from 1:00 to 3:00 for our garden opening which includes a presentation by Shoma Haque in the parlor followed by refreshments and a tour of the native border. Join us at this celebration by buying a ticket for $10 or by sponsoring a plant! $25* Sponsors a Perennial | $50* Sponsors a Shrub | $100* Sponsors a Tree *plus donation processing fee (Both options are accessible under the \"select tickets\" button on the right.)",

Depending on group ability and interest, we may summit a mountain, explore a waterfall, stay at camp to learn skills, swim, and/or fish. The hike will require hiking up to 5 miles or more on varied elevation and terrain each day and students are required to bring most of their own gear, however, some gear is available to rent. Guineafowl Adventure Company has tents, backpacks, sleeping pads, and sleeping bags available should students need to borrow anything for the trip. Food will be provided, please inform us of any dietary restrictions, preferences, or allergies. A shuttle service will be available from Arlington, MA to the Lincoln Woods Trailhead in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. You may meet us in Arlington to drop your child off, or bring them straight to the trailhead. We will make sure everyone has the right gear before we head out on our hike. A detailed gear list will be sent to students before the trip. This is an overnight trip in the backcountry with highly trained instructors who spend a lot of their days in the wilderness. We are excited to be offering this as a course, and try to be accomodating to everyone. We ask that you are realistic in the expectations with your child in regards to physical ability, homesickness, and getting alot with other people their age. Each individual impacts the group dynamic and there is a certain expectation that everyone will respect eachother and be able to make it to the campsite. We act as a group on backcountry trips and never leave anyone behind, however we have a plan and must make it to the campsite for the night. If there are any questions or concerns, please reach out to us. This trip will start Saturday morning and end Sunday evening. Exact times will be communicated before the expedition. This course is open to students ages 11-15.",

He will be joined in conversation by Moira Weigel ‚ÄîAssistant Professor of Comparative Literature and Faculty Associate of the Berkman Klein Center and the Fairbank Center at Harvard, and the author of Voices from the Valley and Labor of Love ‚Äîand Max Gladstone ‚ÄîHugo Award-winning author of This is How You Lose the Time War .

About More Everything Forever This \"wild and utterly engaging narrative\" (Melanie Mitchell) shows why Silicon Valley‚Äôs heartless, baseless, and foolish obsessions‚Äîwith escaping death, building AI tyrants, and creating limitless growth‚Äîare about oligarchic power, not preparing for the future Tech billionaires have decided that they should determine our futures for us. According to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, and more, the only good future for humanity is one powered by technology: trillions of humans living in space, functionally immortal, served by superintelligent AIs. In More Everything Forever , science journalist Adam Becker investigates these wildly implausible and often profoundly immoral visions of tomorrow‚Äîand shows why, in reality, there is no good evidence that they will, or should, come to pass. Nevertheless, these obsessions fuel fears that overwhelm reason‚Äîfor example, that a rogue AI will exterminate humanity‚Äîat the expense of essential work on solving crucial problems like climate change. What‚Äôs more, these futuristic visions cloak a hunger for power under dreams of space colonies and digital immortality. The giants of Silicon Valley claim that their ideas are based on science, but the reality is darker: they come from a jumbled mix of shallow futurism and racist pseudoscience. More Everything Forever exposes the powerful and sinister ideas that dominate Silicon Valley, challenging us to see how foolish, and dangerous, these visions of the future are. Bios Adam Becker is a science journalist with a PhD in astrophysics. He has written for the New York Times , the BBC, NPR, Scientific American , New Scientist , Quanta, and other publications. His first book, What Is Real? , was a New York Times Book Review Editor‚Äôs Choice and was long-listed for the PEN Literary Science Writing Award. He has been a science journalism fellow at the Santa Fe Institute and a science communicator in residence at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. He lives in California. Moira Weigel is the Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature, Faculty Associate of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, and Faculty Associate of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University. She has a PhD from Yale University, 2018 a MPhil from Cambridge University, 2008, and a BA, Harvard University, 2007. Her first book, Labor of Love: the Invention of Dating (2016) has been translated into six languages and appeared in dozens of outlets including The New Yorker , The New York Times , The Economist , The Washington Post , The Atlantic , The Guardian , The Wall Street Journal , NPR , CNN , and HBO. Her second book, co-edited with Ben Tarnoff, Voices from the Valley: Tech Workers Talk About What They Do and How They Do It (2020) has received positive reviews from The New York Times, Wired, The Nation, and the Los Angeles Review of Books , among other outlets, and was named one of Wired‚Äòs ‚Äú8 Best Books About Artificial Intelligence to Read Now‚Äù. Hugo-, Nebula-, and Locus Award winning author Max Gladstone has been thrown from a horse in Mongolia and once wrecked a bicycle in Angkor Wat. He is the author of many books, including Empress of Forever, the Craft Sequence of fantasy novels, and, with Amal El-Mohtar, the internationally bestselling This is How You Lose the Time War .

        "about": "The Transition-AI series is back in Boston for 2025, with a focus on infrastructure. The race for AI supremacy is already having a profound effect on developing digital and energy infrastructure. Tech giants see AI as the next industrial revolution, and are feverishly planning and building new data centers equipped with purpose-built computing, cooling, and power solutions for this new age. Collectively, they are set to spend over $320 billion annually on the computing and power infrastructure to support their AI ambitions ‚Äì with the bulk of that investment in the U.S. The biggest limiting factor for growth is not chips, servers, or land ‚Äî it‚Äôs energy availability. The urgency to build new data centers quickly, combined with zero-carbon commitments from hyperscalers, is driving innovative thinking around how to develop energy- and resource-efficient computing capacity. It is also raising questions about how to pay for the infrastructure, and how quickly clean, firm options can scale. There are many factors that will have large consequences for data center developers and operators, utilities, IPPs, and project financiers: How reliable are power demand forecasts in the face of such a dynamic AI market? How will the new administration benefit or inhibit differing sources of energy? What role will the big oil majors play as they re-examine their strategies around participating in the power market? What role will nuclear play, and how soon should the market take it seriously? How will the market for virtual power plants, distributed energy resources, and microgrids evolve and adapt to a system with very large loads? How will colocation strategies evolve to circumvent interconnection backlogs? Can data centers reliably act as grid assets rather than solely as centers of demand? Is the grid ready to accommodate these large loads at a time when resilience is challenged by increasing weather and wildfire events? Transition-AI 2025 brings together leaders in technology, finance, power markets, and energy and digital infrastructure development to explore how the landscape and options for powering data centers is evolving, and if it still can be accomplished sustainably. Through case studies, interactive discussions, and expert presentations, we'll examine innovations in planning, developing, powering and financing the infrastructure necessary to meet the demand for AI computing. Who should attend? Transition-AI 2025 is designed for decision-makers involved in financing, developing, and operating energy and data center infrastructure. Attendees will include: Clean energy developers and IPPs Project finance leaders from commercial banks Data center operators and developers Distributed energy solution providers Transmission developers Utility finance and strategy executives Infrastructure advisory and risk management professionals Energy policy and regulatory experts",

        "about": "Join us on Thursday , May 1 from 3‚Äì5pm ET for a guided architectural walking tour of Boston's South End. Join Hacin President and Creative Director, David Hacin, FAIA, on a walking tour through his home neighborhood that will highlight classic South End moments such as the bow-front townhouses of Union Park and the vibrant thoroughfare of Tremont Street, as well as the up and coming SoWa Art and Design District (with nods to the firm‚Äôs various projects from the past three decades along the way). The tour will last approximately two hours with a networking session at Tatte on Harrison Avenue to start and ending at the Boston Center for the Arts. The South End has a long history of reinventing itself. Comprised of mostly marshland during the time of Boston‚Äôs founding, the neighborhood was filled in in the mid-1800s and was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Most recently, its transformation in the last thirty years has changed it from a neighborhood trapped in a frustrating cycle of neglect and disinvestment to one of the most vibrant and beloved parts of Boston, with a resonant architectural character and an effective process of incremental urbanism. Architecture and design firm Hacin has long called the South End its home and the firm‚Äôs extensive body of work in the neighborhood includes townhouses and historic renovations, restaurants, a public park, a community garden, hundreds of housing units across the spectrum of affordable and luxury, and a non-profit headquarters. Over the studio‚Äôs thirty-year history, Hacin has demonstrated a commitment to the community and has been grateful to play a part in the area‚Äôs current success.

We will hear a talk from Ben Byboth from Commonwealth Fusion Systems detailing why fusion energy may be closer than we think! Speaker: Ben Byboth is the head of commercial strategy and business development at Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS). With a strong background in the energy sector, he previously held leadership positions at Eversource, Entergy, and NextEra, where he was responsible for launching new energy ventures, leading grid modernization efforts, operating power plants and creating innovative regulatory strategies. Drawing upon his eight years of service as a US Navy submariner, Ben is now focused on driving the commercialization of fusion energy at CFS. Ben earned an MBA from Tulane University and a B.S. in Nuclear Engineering Technologies. Abstract: Fusion Energy : Closer than you think Fusion energy offers the potential for a transformative shift in how we power our world: clean, abundant, and inherently safe. Recent progress in fusion energy research, particularly in areas like high-temperature superconductors, suggests that commercially viable fusion power may be achievable sooner than previously thought. This talk will argue that fusion energy is \"closer than you think\" by showcasing the rapid pace of innovation in fusion research and technology, with a focus on the progress of CFS, the world's largest private fusion company. We'll discuss the potential impact of fusion on addressing climate change and energy security, and outline the key steps needed to bring this game-changing energy source to reality. This presentation will provide an overview of the current state of the fusion industry that is accelerating progress towards net energy gain and sustainable fusion power plants.

        "about": "Instructor - Jess Holz Jess Holz (b. 1985) creates artworks which give the viewer a peek into invisible worlds, as well as a chance to reflect on the influence of scientific visual culture on our collective imagination. She received an MFA in Art+Technology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; and has worked in several labs and imaging facilities, gaining valuable technical experience with a number of microscopic imaging techniques. She currently works as an electron microscopy research fellow at a Boston University lab which investigates the neural circuitry underlying thought and emotion. The discrepancy between what can be perceived by eye and what is imaged by the microscope has fostered her fascination with perceptual systems along with the optical properties of materials. Jess actively exploits this in photography and installation. Class Description Taught by artist/scientist Jess Holz, this experimental photography workshop explores and celebrates plankton biodiversity through hands-on interactive ‚ÄòPlankton Painting‚Äô or chronophotography of plankton (pond critters) collected from local waterways such as Chandler Pond and Boston Harbor, in which you will use a microscope along with special software Jess wrote to create beautiful artworks of plankton motion and behavior as they swim on the microscope slide. Chronophotography visualizes dynamic behaviors and strange movements, such as the helical paths of flagellates and the microscopic water currents rotifers generate when they filter feed. Jess considers these images like automatic drawings or paintings, the plankton create the marks and composition, all happening at the millimeter scale. This workshop primarily uses darkfield and fluorescence microscopy, but participants also get to play with other advanced microscopy techniques using Jess‚Äô high-end Leica DMRB microscope equipped with a number of advanced upgrades. Students will leave the class with a print of their favorite ‚Äòpainting,‚Äô all photos from the class will be uploaded to: https://www.flickr.com/photos/planktonpainting Material Fee The materials fee for this class is $10. This is separate from the ticket price and is to reimburse the instructor for any tools or materials used in this class. This will be paid once, directly to the instructor at the start of the first class meeting. This instructor accepts payments in cash or through Venmo or PayPal. Class Goals - Make visible what exactly lives in our local waterways‚Äîthe vibrant and dynamic life we cannot see. - Instruction and introduction to basic plankton identification and ecology. - Knowledge of the distinct forms of life between different nearby ponds, as well as contrasting the composition of plankton in marine water vs. pond water. - Students will learn fascinating facts about plankton behavior and gain an intimate knowledge of how they move using this unique timelapse technique. - Students will learn tips for composing photos using chronophotography, and may inquire with Jess about using her software with their own microscope. Material Supplied Materials fee includes one sheet of Hahnemuhle photo rag metallic archival inkjet paper for a print of your favorite photo taken during the class. Jess will provide water samples collected from Boston Harbor and Chandler pond. Students Should Bring Pen/paper/notebook for taking notes. You are welcome to bring your own water samples, but it is not guaranteed we will have time to look at them. Prerequisites Students must be 13 years or older, all students under 18 years old must be accompanied by and under the direct supervision of an adult. Class Policies Learn more about our class and ticket cancelation policies Here . Please email education@artisansasylum.com with any questions.",

        "about": "Harvard Book Store welcomes Ocean Vuong ‚Äîauthor of the critically acclaimed poetry collections Night Sky with Exit Wounds and Time Is a Mother , as well as the New York Times bestselling novel On Earth We‚Äôre Briefly Gorgeous ‚Äîfor a discussion of his new novel The Emperor of Gladness . He will be joined in conversation by Emiko Tamagawa ‚Äîsenior producer for Here & Now for their arts and culture segments. Ticketing Tickets include admission for one and one hardcover copy of The Emperor of Gladness pre-signed by the author. Note: Books bundled with tickets may only be picked up at the venue the night of the event, and cannot be picked up in-store beforehand.

This offer expires after 30 days. Please note we cannot guarantee signed copies will be available to ticket holders who do not attend the event. About The Emperor of Gladness Ocean Vuong returns with a bighearted novel about chosen family, unexpected friendship, and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive. One late summer evening in the post-industrial town of East Gladness, Connecticut, nineteen-year-old Hai stands on the edge of a bridge in pelting rain, ready to jump, when he hears someone shout across the river. The voice belongs to Grazina, an elderly widow succumbing to dementia, who convinces him to take another path. Bereft and out of options, he quickly becomes her caretaker. Over the course of the year, the unlikely pair develops a life-altering bond, one built on empathy, spiritual reckoning, and heartbreak, with the power to transform Hai‚Äôs relationship to himself, his family, and a community on the brink. Following the cycles of history, memory, and time, The Emperor of Gladness shows the profound ways in which love, labor, and loneliness form the bedrock of American life. At its heart is a brave epic about what it means to exist on the fringes of society and to reckon with the wounds that haunt our collective soul. Hallmarks of Ocean Vuong‚Äôs writing‚Äîformal innovation, syntactic dexterity, and the ability to twin grit with grace through tenderness‚Äîare on full display in this story of loss, hope, and how far we would go to possess one of life‚Äôs most fleeting mercies: a second chance. Bios Ocean Vuong is the author of the critically acclaimed poetry collections Night Sky with Exit Wounds and Time Is a Mother , as well as the New York Times bestselling novel On Earth We‚Äôre Briefly Gorgeous . A recipient of the MacArthur ‚ÄúGenius Grant\" and the American Book Award, he used to work as a fast-food server, which inspired The Emperor of Gladness . Born in Saigon, Vietnam, he currently splits his time between Northampton, Massachusetts, and New York City. Emiko Tamagawa is a senior producer for Here & Now . Tamagawa produces arts and culture segments for Here & Now. She studied psychology and drama at Yale and Brandeis, and toured colleges and high schools with her one-woman show about the Japanese-American internment before turning to radio.

        "about": "Harvard Book Store welcomes beloved New York Times bestselling author Alison Bechdel ‚Äîauthor of Fun Home , which was a Time magazine #1 Book of the Year graphic memoir and was adapted into a Tony Award‚Äìwinning musical‚Äîto celebrate the release of her new comic novel Spent , a laugh-out-loud, brilliant, and passionately political work of autofiction.

This offer expires after 30 days. Please note we cannot guarantee signed copies will be available to ticket holders who do not attend the event. About Spent In Alison Bechdel‚Äôs hilariously skewering and gloriously cast new comic novel confection, a cartoonist named Alison Bechdel, running a pygmy goat sanctuary in Vermont, is existentially irked by a climate-challenged world and a citizenry on the brink of civil war. She wonders: Can she pull humanity out of its death spiral by writing a scathingly self-critical memoir about her own greed and privilege? Meanwhile, Alison‚Äôs first graphic memoir about growing up with her father, a taxidermist who specialized in replicas of Victorian animal displays, has been adapted into a highly successful TV series. It‚Äôs a phenomenon that makes Alison, formerly on the cultural margins, the envy of her friend group (recognizable as characters, now middle-aged and living communally in Vermont, from Bechdel‚Äôs beloved comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For ). As the TV show Death and Taxidermy racks up Emmy after Emmy‚Äîand when Alison‚Äôs Pauline Bunyanesque partner Holly posts an instructional wood-chopping video that goes viral‚ÄîAlison‚Äôs own envy spirals. Why couldn‚Äôt she be the writer for a critically lauded and wildly popular reality TV show‚Ä¶like Queer Eye ...showing people how to free themselves from consumer capitalism and live a more ethical life?!! Spent ‚Äôs rollicking and masterful denouement‚Äîmaking the case for seizing what‚Äôs true about life in the world at this moment, before it‚Äôs too late‚Äîonce again proves that ‚Äúnobody does it better‚Äù ( New York Times Book Review ) than the real Alison Bechdel. Bio Alison Bechdel‚Äôs cult following for her early comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For expanded wildly for her family memoirs, the New York Times bestselling and Time magazine #1 Book of the Year graphic memoir Fun Home , adapted into a Tony Award‚Äìwinning musical, and Are You My Mother? Most recently, The Secret to Superman Strength was named a New York Times Best Graphic Novel of 2021. Bechdel has been named a MacArthur Fellow, among many other honors.

        "about": "Join the Transnational Literature Series at Brookline Booksmith for an in-store event with translator Haleh Liza Gafori to discuss and celebrate the release of Water by Rumi. A follow-up to her ground-breaking translations of Rumi in Gold , poet and musician Haleh Liza Gafori translates a new selection of work by the great Persian mystic that will muster the soul and stir the spirit. Water expands on Gold , Haleh Liza Gafori's inspired and widely praised translation of the lyric poetry of the Persian mystic Rumi. As in Gold , Gafori renders with fluid grace and moving immediacy these indisputable masterworks of world literature, drawing on the deep well of Rumi‚Äôs work to bring out the worldly wit and wisdom that accompany his otherworldly summons. Behold the divine within and without, he tells us. Question the gnawing hunger for material possessions, fame, and fortune, and the fear of emptiness that drives it. Muster the soul, and experience a more compassionate and liberated state of mind. An eco-poet before his time, Rumi celebrates the immensity and wonder of the natural world while warning us of the havoc that greed and the pursuit of power wreak upon us and our world. His flights of dazzling imagery open up heart-stopping glimpses of the divine, challenging readers to wake from oblivion, and above all, to surrender to the transformative power of Love. Gafori is an acclaimed vocalist and musician as well as a gifted linguist and poet, and in her translations Rumi's poetry sings and beckons as nowhere else. Hers is the work, as the poet Marilyn Hacker has said, \"of someone who is at once an acute and enamored reader of the original Farsi text, a dedicated miner of context and backstory, and, best of all, a marvelous poet in English.‚Äù Rumi, Molana, JalƒÅl ad-Dƒ´n Mohammad Balkhy (1207‚Äì1273), was born in or near the city of Balkh, in present-day Afghanistan. Widely considered the greatest poet of the Persian language, Rumi‚Äôs major works are the Masnavi , a six-volume collection of mystical teachings, and the Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi , a collection of lyric poetry. He died and was buried in Konya, Turkey. Haleh Liza Gafori is an Iranian American translator, performance artist, poet, and musician born in New York City. Her work has been published by Harvard Review , The Brooklyn Rail , Columbia University Press, and others. A recipient of a MacDowell fellowship and an NYSCA grant, she presents the poetry of Rumi at universities and institutions, including Stanford University, Lincoln Center, and the Academy of American Poets. Her first collection of Rumi translations, Gold , is also published by NYRB Classics.

Hundreds of recipes later, Dylan now entertains millions across Tik Tok, YouTube, and Instagram with his unique style and fast jokes. He is the author of the global bestseller Baking Yesteryear . Dylan lives in Laramie, Wyoming. Masking Policy Masks are encouraged but not required for this event.",

        "about": "Harvard Book Store welcomes Ron Chernow ‚Äïprizewinning author of seven books, including the National Book Award winner The House of Morgan , the Pulitzer Prize winner Washington: A Life , and the George Washington Book Prize winner Alexander Hamilton ‚Äïfor a discussion of his new biography Mark Twain. Ticketing There are two ticket options for this event. 1. Book-Included Ticket: Includes admission for one and one hardcover copy of Mark Twain , pre-signed by Ron Chernow. 2. Admission-Only Ticket: Includes admission for one. Note: Books bundled with tickets may only be picked up at the venue the night of the event, and cannot be picked up in-store beforehand. Ticket holders who purchased a book-included ticket and are unable to attend the event will be able to pick up their book at Harvard Book Store up to 30 days following the event. This offer expires after 30 days. Please note we cannot guarantee signed copies will be available to ticket holders who do not attend the event. About Mark Twain Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow illuminates the full, fascinating, and complex life of the writer long celebrated as the father of American literature, Mark Twain Before he was Mark Twain, he was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. Born in 1835, the man who would become America‚Äôs first, and most influential, literary celebrity spent his childhood dreaming of piloting steamboats on the Mississippi. But when the Civil War interrupted his career on the river, the young Twain went west to the Nevada Territory and accepted a job at a local newspaper, writing dispatches that attracted attention for their brashness and humor. It wasn‚Äôt long before the former steamboat pilot from Missouri was recognized across the country for his literary brilliance, writing under a pen name that he would immortalize. In this richly nuanced portrait of Mark Twain, acclaimed biographer Ron Chernow brings his considerable powers to bear on a man who shamelessly sought fame and fortune, and crafted his persona with meticulous care. After establishing himself as a journalist, satirist, and lecturer, he eventually settled in Hartford with his wife and three daughters, where he went on to write The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . He threw himself into the hurly-burly of American culture, and emerged as the nation‚Äôs most notable political pundit. At the same time, his madcap business ventures eventually bankrupted him; to economize, Twain and his family spent nine eventful years in exile in Europe. He suffered the death of his wife and two daughters, and the last stage of his life was marked by heartache, political crusades, and eccentric behavior that sometimes obscured darker forces at play. Drawing on Twain‚Äôs bountiful archives, including thousands of letters and hundreds of unpublished manuscripts, Chernow masterfully captures the man whose career reflected the country‚Äôs westward expansion, industrialization, and foreign wars, and who was the most important white author of his generation to grapple so fully with the legacy of slavery. Today, more than one hundred years after his death, Twain‚Äôs writing continues to be read, debated, and quoted. In this brilliant work of scholarship, a moving tribute to the writer‚Äôs talent and humanity, Chernow reveals the magnificent and often maddening life of one of the most original characters in American history. Bio Ron Chernow is the prizewinning author of seven previous books and the recipient of the 2015 National Humanities Medal. His first book, The House of Morgan , won the National Book Award, Washington: A Life won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography, and Alexander Hamilton ‚Äîthe inspiration for the Broadway musical‚Äîwon the George Washington Book Prize. He has twice been a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and is one of only three living biographers to have won the Gold Medal for Biography of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. A past president of PEN America, Chernow has been the recipient of nine honorary doctorates. Masking Policy Masks are encouraged but not required for this event.",

        "about": "Join the Transnational Literature Series at Brookline Booksmith for an in-store event with Daniel Tam-Claiborne to discuss and celebrate the release of Transplants . He will be in conversation with writer Aube Rey Lescure. A harrowing and poignant novel following two young women in pursuit of kinship and self-discovery who yearn to survive in a world that doesn‚Äôt know where either of them belong. On a university campus in rural Qixian, Lin and Liz make an improbable pair: Lin, a Chinese student closer to her menagerie of pets than to her peers, and Liz, a Chinese American teacher grieving her mother‚Äôs sudden death. They‚Äôre each met with hostility‚ÄîLin by her classmates, who mock her for dating a white foreigner; Liz by her fellow English teachers, who exploit their privilege‚Äîand forge an unlikely friendship. After a startling betrayal that results in Lin‚Äôs expulsion, they swap places. Lin becomes convinced to pursue her degree at a community college near Liz‚Äôs Ohio hometown, while Liz searches for answers as to what drove her parents to leave China before she was born. But when a global catastrophe deepens the fissures between modern-day China and an increasingly fractured United States, Lin and Liz‚Äîfar from home and estranged from themselves‚Äîare forced to confront both the familiar and the strange in each other. Unspooling over the course of a single extraordinary year in our not-yet-distant past and in small towns from Dandong to Deadwood, Transplants is a piercing story of migration, belonging, and the parts of ourselves that get lost in translation. Alternating between Liz and Lin‚Äôs perspectives, it is a lyrical and moving exploration of race, love, power, and freedom that illuminates the limits and possibilities of what can happen when we open ourselves to the unknown and reveals how even our fiercest differences may bring us closer than we might ever imagine. Daniel Tam-Claiborne is a multiracial writer, multimedia producer, and nonprofit director. He is the author of the short story collection What Never Leaves , and his writing has appeared in Catapult , Literary Hub , Off Assignment , The Rumpus , HuffPost , and elsewhere.

        "location": "Brookline Booksmith 279 Harvard Street Brookline, MA 02446 Show map",
        "about": "Join the Transnational Literature Series at Brookline Booksmith for an in-store event with writer Iman Mersal to discuss and celebrate the release of Motherhood and Its Ghosts and Traces of Enayat . From one of the preeminent poets of the Arabic-speaking world, come two brilliant and personal works of creative nonfiction retracing and exploring the lives of women. Iman Mersal has only one photograph of her mother, who died giving birth at age twenty-seven. But the woman portrayed in it strikes her as very unlike the one in her fleeting childhood memories, in mood, expression, dress. When Mersal has a child of her own decades later, she begins to wonder whether it‚Äôs possible to depict a mother with any degree of fidelity. How to represent‚Äîin photography, dream, memory, or writing‚Äîan individual whose complex inner landscape has suddenly come under threat of looming archetypes? What is hidden in traditional representations of moth¬≠erhood? What lies outside the narrative in which motherhood ‚Äúmeans giving, the melding of two distinct selves, a love unlimited and unconditional‚Äù? Sifting through the archives of motherhood, including journal entries, photo¬≠graphs, and the writings that have informed her own poetic practice, Mersal privileg¬≠es questions over answers, drifting over arriving, allowing a form of motherhood to exist in these pages unbounded. And in Traces of Enayat , winner of the prestigious Sheikh Zayed Book Award, Mersal retraces the mysterious life and erasure of Egyptian literature's tragic heroine, Enayat al-Zayyat. Cairo, 1963: four years before her lone novel is finally published, the writer Enayat al-Zayyat takes her own life at age twenty-seven. For the next three decades, it's as if Enayat never existed at all. Years later, when celebrated Egyptian poet Iman Mersal stumbles upon Enayat's long-forgotten Love and Silence in a Cairo book stall, she embarks on a journey of reflection and rediscovery that leads her ever closer to the world and work of Enayat. In this luminous biographical detective story, Mersal retraces Enayat's life and afterlife though interviews with family members and friend, even tracking down the apartments, schools, and sanatoriums where Enayat spent her days. As Mersal maps two simultaneous psychogeographies‚Äîfrom the glamor of golden-age Egyptian cinema to the Cairo of Mersal's own past‚Äîa remarkable portrait emerges of two women striving to live on their own terms. With Traces of Enayat , Iman Mersal embraces the reciprocal relationship between a text and its reader, between past and present, between author and subject. Iman Mersal is an Egyptian writer, translator, and literary scholar. A professor of Arabic language and literature at the University of Alberta, she is the author of five books of Arabic poetry. In English translation, her poems have appeared in The New Republic , The New York Review of Books , Parnassus , The Paris Review , and The Nation , among others. The Threshold , translated by Robyn Creswell and published in 2022, was shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize and won the 2023 National Translation Award. Mersal received the 2021 Sheikh Zayed Book Award in Literature for her creative nonfiction book Traces of Enayat , published by Transit Books in 2024. Translator Robin Moger is a translator of Arabic to English who lives in Barcelona. His translations of prose and poetry have appeared in Blackbox Manifold , The White Review , Asymptote , Words Without Borders , Washington Square Review , Michigan Review , and elsewhere. The Transnational Literature Series at Brookline Booksmith The Transnational Series focuses on stories of migration, the intersection of politics and literature, and works in translation and is supported by the independent bookstore Brookline Booksmith.

        "about": "Searching for a partner can be horrifically painful. But board games are always awesome. So what if you combined board games and finding a partner? Picture this: You sit down for a night of games. A gaming concierge walks you through several games over the course of the night. You play classics you love and discover brand new games you've never heard of, playing each with a different group of fun singles. All while in a great establishment with plenty of delicious options on tap. At the end of the night, you give your gaming concierge a list of the folks you met that you'd like to date and a list of those you met that you'd like to just hang out with as friends. If any two people put down the same name as each other in either column, then your gaming concierge will make sure you get each other's e-mail address and you can coordinate a time to hang out. Best case scenario: You find true love, discover some awesome board games, and make some new friends. Bad case scenario: You accomplish only one of those three things, which is still pretty great. Worst case scenario: There will be alcohol. Before you decide to buy tickets, a few basics we should cover: 1) This event is for men & women, ages 25-39. We also have events for other age groups, an event for gay men and an event for queer women. And we're hoping to add events to serve even more people in the future! Head over to www.quirkevents.com/boston to see what else we have to offer. (If you scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, you'll be able to join our mailing list and get notified about future events. Plus, joining our mailing list gets you 50% off your first ticket purchase!) 2) Refunds are only available to those who cancel with more than 48 hours' notice, in order to make sure we have enough time to find a replacement for you and keep the event well-populated. (Exceptions will be made for emergency situations on a case-by-case basis). After that, we're blowing the money from your ticket sale on something awesome and nonrefundable. 3) If we get to 24 hours before the event and still haven't sold five tickets for each gender, we will cancel the event (and notify you). When we have run this event in the past, tickets have consistently sold very well, so we don't expect this to happen. But we thought we should cover this in case it came up. 4) How many games we have and which ones we use will be based in part on how many people attend, so we can't tell you for sure what we'll have right now. But the goal is for all of them to be fun, light, easy-to-learn games. Selection will include games from both the something-you-have-played-before category and the something-you-haven't-played-before category. The games are also chosen because they often tend to spark conversation and leave room for chatting with new people as you play. All games will be group games, meaning you'll get a chance to meet a handful of people with each new round. 5) To stay up to date on everything we have going on here at Quirk Events, follow us on Instagram here! 6) Dorchester Brewing is a 21+ venue. No outside food drinks are allowed inside.",

        "about": "We are hosting two different workshops at NESF. Build a Theremin in an Altoids tin for on-the-go fun sounds and exprimentation OR Build a Tank Reverb EuroRack module to add thick drippy reverb to your musical creations. We will guide you at every step along the way. The Cram Audio DIY Tank Reverb is an analog circuit that uses an actual spring reverb tank to gives you a lush reverb effect. The module offers control for Mix and Feedback allowing you to tailor the reverb from subtle to overdriven, with many interesting settings along the way, helping you to craft the unique tone required to set your composition apart from the crowd. The Cram Audio DIY Tank Reverb drives the reverb tank via discrete transistors to ensure rich clean reverb tone. The Mix potentiometer helps you to proportion the wet & dry signals and the feedback potentiometer helps to extend the natural decay of the reverb tank - almost to infinity if desired. Learn to build your very own ùêìùê°ùêûùê´ùêûùê¶ùê¢ùêß! You'll be experimenting with eerie sci-fi sounds in no time. The Theremin is an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the performer. It's named after its inventor, Leon Theremin, who patented the device in 1928. The ùóîùóπùòÅùóºùó∂ùó±ùòÄ ùóßùóµùó≤ùóøùó≤ùó∫ùó∂ùóª is controlled by of two antennas which function as position sensors. Each antenna forms one half of a capacitor with each of the thereminist's hands as the other half of the capacitor. These antennas capacitively sense the relative position of you hands and control oscillators for frequency with one hand, and volume with the other. The electric signals from the Theremin are sent to an amplifier via a 1/4\" jack. Learn and save. You will solder, assemble components, and customize your very own musical instrument. No prior experience soldering is necessary - bring your creativity and enthusiasm to learn more about effect pedals! Don't miss this opportunity to dive deep into the world of DIY electronics and create a unique and sophisticated effect pedal. If you need help with your circuit, your instructors have 20+ years‚Äô experience building, designing, and troubleshooting analog and digital circuitry. So rest assured that we will get your effect working and get you jamming. Expect this workshop to last 3 ‚Äì 4 hours. You‚Äôll leave with a working module and a good handful of electronics knowledge. I hope to see you there!",

A local player dropped dead in this otherwise friendly battle of wits, and the game hasn't run again since... until tonight. Tonight, we're enlisting your help to solve this mystery the only way we know how: Through a game of pub trivia. Each round, your group will answer trivia questions, which will, in turn, unlock details of the murder, uncover backstories and ultimately answer the greatest question of them all: Whodunnit? So form a team with your sleuthiest friends and see if you can solve The Case of The Poisoned Patron! Please note: This is not a theatrical production featuring actors or audience roles or some of the other staples of a murder mystery production, rather this is a trivia game with a murder mystery puzzle interwoven. A few other items of note... --------- 1) This is our second time running this event at Boston Public Market, and we also host it in other Boston locations and elsewhere in New England. They are all the same game featuring the same key elements and questions, so we ask players not to sign up for more than one event. However, for those of you dying to play again, we have good news: If this continues to get as good a reaction as it has so far, we plan to do a new mystery later in 2025. If you click the \"upcoming events\" tab at www.quirkevents.com , and choose the city of your choice, then scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, you'll be able to join our mailing list and get notified about future events. Plus, joining our mailing list gets you 50% off your first ticket purchase! 2) Refunds are only available to those who cancel with more than 48 hours' notice. After that, we're blowing the money from your ticket sale on something extravagant and nonrefundable. 3) To stay up to date on everything we have going on at Quirk Events, follow us on Instagram here!",

        "about": "Gay Men Board Game Speed Dating at Club Cafe Searching for a partner can be horrifically painful. But board games are always awesome. So what if you combined board games and finding a partner? Picture this: You sit down for a night of games. A gaming concierge walks you through several games over the course of the night. You play classics you love and discover brand new games you've never heard of, playing each with a different group of fun singles. All while in a great establishment with plenty of delicious options on tap. At the end of the night, you give your gaming concierge a list of the folks you met that you'd like to date and a list of those you met that you'd like to just hang out with as friends. If any two people put down the same name as each other in either column, then your gaming concierge will make sure you get each other's e-mail address and you can coordinate a time to hang out. Best case scenario: You find true love, discover some awesome board games, and make some new friends. Bad case scenario: You accomplish only one of those three things, which is still pretty great. Worst case scenario: There will be alcohol. Before you decide to buy tickets, a few basics we should cover: 1) This is an all-inclusive event for men looking to date other men. Non-binary individuals and anyone else who feels like they would be a good fit are encouraged to attend. If you are a woman looking to date another woman, or if you are looking to date someone of the opposite sex, you can find out more about our other speed dating events at www.quirkevents.com/public-events-boston . 2) Refunds are only available to those who cancel with more than 48 hours' notice, in order to make sure we have enough time to find a replacement for you and keep the event well-populated. (Exceptions will be made for emergency situations on a case-by-case basis). After that, we're blowing the money from your ticket sale on something awesome and nonrefundable. 3) If we get to 24 hours before the event and still haven't sold eight tickets, we will cancel the event (and notify you). We think this is very unlikely but wanted to include a note about it in case that happened. 4) How many games we have and which ones we use will be based in part on how many people attend, so we can't tell you for sure what we'll have right now. But the goal is for all of them to be fun, light, easy-to-learn games. Selection will include games from both the something-you-have-played-before category and the something-you-haven't-played-before category. The games are also chosen because they often tend to spark conversation and leave room for chatting with new people as you play. All games will be group games, meaning you'll get a chance to meet a handful of people with each new round. 5) Desperately wish you could attend, but you have plans on this date or the tickets you want are sold out? E-mail hello@quirkevents.com, and we will add you to our please-notify-me-next-time-you-create-an-event mailing list. 6) Follow us here on Instagram to stay up-to-date on all our events around town!",

The pitch session allows the artist to give more information about their aspirations for the project, and outline what they might need to bring their creation into its next phase. Participating artists: Lindsay Gibbons Katherine Marotta Bridget Nicolo Anugraha Raman Alexis Tsiramanes One of the central questions connecting this year's aMaSSiT cohort is \" how do I create dance projects that allow me to integrate my whole self? \". Consequently, these artists are developing creative pitches at the intersection of science, health, and their embodied realities. Join us to see what they have been up to, and through your feedback help some form the future of these works. About the aMaSSiT program: aMaSSiT (a M ake it S hare it, S how it lab) is an artist's next deep step in identifying and articulating their unique choreographic voice. The Dance Complex‚Äôs aMaSSiT Choreography Lab has evolved to an in-depth curriculum focusing on choreographic tool building and best artistic business practices. This unique program, open to creators in all dance genres, is structured to both foster those early in their careers and to deeply challenge more experienced artists. The 2025 season of aMaSSiT, a collaboration between The Dance Complex and Monkeyhouse , develops tools for building momentum to transform an idea into a larger project. --- The ground level lobby and second floor performance space are ADA compliant. There is a motorized lift that can bring one person at a time from the ground floor to the second floor should a guest wish to use it. There is no elevator.

        "about": "What is ‚Äúelegance‚Äù in mechanical design? As a subjective concept, is it relevant to a field normally focused on technical matters? And if so, how is it embodied in a kinetic object? In this talk, Chris attempts to answer what constitutes an ‚Äúelegant‚Äù design solution to a mechanical problem and why it‚Äôs important (to him, anyway). Chris Fitch is a sculptor, engineer and inventor. His prize-winning mechanical sculptures, installations and performance-based artwork have been presented internationally. His puppets and state-of-the art miniature theaters have appeared with major symphony productions in Berlin, London, New York and Los Angeles. His credits for work in animation include Sesame Street, Motorola, Disneyland, and Samsung. Further projects have included the design of a toy factory, independent invention, a tree house bed and breakfast inn in the Philippines, and the development of workshops about kinematics, motion as medium, and foam latex stop motion puppetry. These days he designs industrial robots. More information can be found at www.chrisfitchsculpture.com .",

At the northern edge of a land ruled by a monstrous, foreign tyrant lies the wild forest known as the Elmever. The villagers know better than to let their children go near‚Äîonce someone goes in, they never come back out. No one knows the strange and terrifying traps of the Elmever better than Veris Thorn, the only person to ever rescue a child from the forest many years ago. When the Tyrant‚Äôs two young children go missing, Veris is commanded to enter the forest once more and bring them home safe. If Veris fails, the Tyrant will kill her; if she remains in the forest for longer than a day, she will be trapped forevermore. So Veris will travel deep into the Elmever to face traps, riddles, and monsters at the behest of another monster. One misstep will cost everything. ---------------- Tickets for this event are $5, which can be used as $5 credit towards a purchase at SQBG on the day.

        "location": "Regent Theatre 7 Medford Street Arlington, MA 02474 Show map",
        "about": "PETER ASHER: A MUSICAL MEMOIR OF THE 60'S AND BEYOND ‚Äú‚Ä¶as Mr. Asher regaled a delighted audience with stories‚Ä¶ he conjured history in the making, before it was set in stone.‚Äù ‚Äì Stephen Holden, New York Times ‚Äú‚Ä¶the exuberant Mr. Asher knew anyone who rocked and everyone who mattered.‚Äù ‚ÄìWall Street Journal ‚ÄúAn all-around charming and delightful fellow ‚Äî he reminisces about his whole career and it is highly entertaining‚Äù ‚Äì Steve Martin ‚ÄúEverybody should go and see it ‚Äî I‚Äôve seen it myself twice‚Äù ‚Äì Linda Ronstadt \"The Man, The Myth, The Legend! ...and a true friend! Great wit and music. A true storyteller! What more could you possibly want? Don‚Äôt miss this!\"--Hans Zimmer We first came to know him through the global smash ‚ÄúWorld Without Love‚Äù as one half of the British Invasion duo Peter & Gordon. He returns--now a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire-- in ‚ÄúPeter Asher: A Musical Memoir of the 60s and Beyond‚Äù which brings a multimedia experience to the stage, hosted by the two-time Grammy winner for Producer of the Year. Peter Asher moved effortlessly from his role with Peter & Gordon to Music Executive with the Beatles‚Äô Apple Records, then famously- (as in cover of Rolling Stone magazine level famous)- to Producer and Manager, handling the careers of James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt and a host of others. Books abound, documentaries with half-truths (and worse) are all too common, but, now, finally, Mr. Asher tells first hand his tales from the eye of the cultural hurricane in this intimate evening. ‚ÄúMemoir‚Äù includes film footage and photos from Peter‚Äôs considerable personal archive, brought to life with a storyteller‚Äôs gift, transporting audiences back to the heart of 60s popular culture. Icons such as Mick Jagger, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Marianne Faithful, Yoko Ono, Carole King, James Taylor and Linda Ronstadt are among the cast of characters in this narrative ‚Äì along (of course) with the greatly missed Gordon Waller. The evening is filled with the music of Peter & Gordon, including ‚ÄúI Go to Pieces,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue Love Ways,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLady Godiva.‚Äù The songs given to Peter & Gordon by Paul McCartney are also front and center: ‚ÄúWoman,‚Äù ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Want to See You Again,‚Äù Nobody I Know,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWorld Without Love,‚Äù all of which were US Top 40 hits. Peter presents these timeless classics along with other old favourites from that golden era. The show brings the audience through the earliest days of Peter‚Äôs journey all the way to the present day, and projects including his SiriusXM radio show on the Beatles Channel, \"From Me to You\" . Peter's book based on the show, \"The Beatles A to Zed\" was released by MacMillan on October 29, 2019; the book is already in it's third printing. Peter remains a sought after producer, and Memoir delves into that part of his life as well. The Peter Asher-produced CD by Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers, \"The Long Awaited Album\", was released September 22, 2017, with a stand-alone single, \"California' released in January of 2020. They are among several production efforts Steve Martin has asked Mr. Asher to oversee, including a 2018 PBS TV special with Martin Short and the Steep Canyon Rangers. Covered also is Peter‚Äôs production of the ‚ÄúLove Has Come for You‚Äù CD by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell ‚Äî the title track a Grammy Winner in 2014- and the stage show based on it, ‚ÄúBright Star,‚Äù which garnered 5 Tony nominations in its run on Broadway in 2016. A project celebrating Elton John‚Äôs songwriting partnership with Bernie Taupin saw the light of day in 2018, \"Revamped\" ; among the highlights was Ed Sheeran's take on Candle in The Wind\", produced by Mr. Asher. The celebratory collection was a follow up to the Peter Asher-produced special edition of ‚ÄúGoodbye Yellow Brick Road‚Äù -released in March 2014 ‚Äì which featured Ed Sheeran, Imelda May, Fall Out Boy, and others covering songs from that classic album. Peter takes you behind the curtain of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, where he inducted two old friends, the Rolling Stones‚Äô first manager Andrew Loog Oldham and the Beatles‚Äô Manager Brian Epstein. The PBS special ‚ÄúBuddy Holly: Listen to Me -The Ultimate Buddy Party‚Äù is still being aired regularly, and its sister CD, ‚ÄúListen to Me: Buddy Holly‚Äù remains a favorite. His work on soundtracks (\"Amazing Spider-Man 2,‚Äù ‚ÄúMan Of Steel,‚Äù ‚ÄúRush.‚Äù, etc), alongside the legendary Hans Zimmer, is touched on also, as well as the 2017 \"Hans Zimmer Live!\" tour of the USA and Europe that Mr. Asher Directed. August 6, 2021 saw the release, on Compass Records' Red House imprint, the Peter Asher produced \"Why Wait!\" from Kate Taylor. James' \"Sister Kate\" is backed by Albert Lee, Danny Kortchmar, Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, Waddy Wachtel, Victoria Asher, Scarlet Rivera and more. Many of the same cast to worked on the new album by the Bangles' Susanna Hoffs, which Mr. Asher produced was released in 2023. Most recently, Peter and Walter Afanasieff co-produced Barbra Streisand's April 2024 release, ‚ÄòLove Will Survive,‚Äô the theme for Peacock Television‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Tattooist of Auschwitz‚Äô. Now, fifteen years on, ‚ÄúMemoir‚Äù continues to thrill, as the reviews attest. On a more personal note, friends such as Liza Minelli, Eric Idle, Paul Shaffer, Ray Davies, Bill Wyman, Ken Follett, Edie Brickell, Billy Connolly, Jeff Lynne, Paul Simon, Bob Balaban, Joan Collins, Steve Martin, Ed Sheeran, Tony Shalhoub, Linda Ronstadt, and Michael Feinstein have been among the audiences in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and London that have given standing ovations to ‚ÄúPeter Asher: A Musical Memoir of the 60s and Beyond.‚Äù TICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE",

        "about": "TrueVines is a Boston-based band blending '60s British influences with a raw American vibe. Fronted by legendary songwriter Dennis Brennan, this powerhouse lineup features guitarist Andrew Stern, bassist Jim Haggerty, and drummer Chris Anzalone‚Äîall veterans of the local and national music scene. Originally a side project born during the pandemic, TrueVines has evolved into Brennan‚Äôs primary creative outlet, embracing a rougher, high-energy sound steeped in garage rock and soul. Their forthcoming six-song release captures the band‚Äôs unique chemistry: quick, raunchy originals that channel the raw spirit of the ‚Äô60s, soulful struts, and even a nod to their rootsy side with a country ballad. With shout-along choruses, swaggering guitars, and an unapologetic sense of fun, TrueVines proves that rock and roll is still very much alive. Guitarist Andrew Stern, originally from Illinois, honed his craft in Boston after stints in California and New York‚Äôs vibrant music scenes. He has worked across a range of styles with artists like Dennis Brennan, Mark Erelli, and Brian Carpenter and leads several projects, including his adventurous trio, AS3. Stern‚Äôs versatile and inventive guitar work is a cornerstone of TrueVines‚Äô sound. Bassist Jim Haggerty and drummer Chris Anzalone bring decades of experience as first-call studio musicians and live performers. Known for their dynamic and impeccable musicianship, they form the backbone of TrueVines, driving its raw and electric energy. Described by Mod Magazine as ‚Äústill in the attic or the garage, and loving every second of it,‚Äù TrueVines captures the freedom and vitality of a band playing for the sheer joy of it. TrueVines",

Following one of Massachusetts most notable Country artists directing their audience NOT to listen to Bruce Springsteen....Ward Hayden & the Outliers decided the best way to offset that negativity was to do something positive and delve into Springsteen‚Äôs epic catalog. Taking that journey with all its nostalgia, appreciation, and creativity is unequivocally positive. This album plays like a thank you note to The Boss, one that will resonate with Springsteen and Outliers fans alike. This collection of songs was chosen from the soundtrack to many people's lives who grew up in the 70s, 80s, & 90s. These are the songs that played while you hung out in your friend's kitchen, watched TV in your living room, drove your car home from school, or when you partied on the weekends. These songs earned their place in our lives, they've been there for us, they've been along for the ride. Ward Hayden & the Outliers NEW album \"Little by Little\" has taken the songwriting of Bruce Springsteen, channeled it through their country music filled hearts and minds, resulting in something extraordinary and unique. It's The Boss done Outliers-style. It's the music that's been our crutch to lean on, our shoulder to cry on, and the words that we sing out with joy at the top of our lungs. It's the music that taught us to love music, the music that makes us want to keep making more music, and it's meant to be shared.

She has performed and traveled across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Hanneke‚Äôs music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional, described by the Boston Globe as ‚Äúexuberant and rhythmic, somehow wild and innocent, delivered with captivating melodic clarity and an irresistible playfulness.‚Äù The Hanneke Cassel Band features Jenna Moynihan on 5-string fiddle and Keith Murphy on guitar/vocals. Jenna Moynihan is regarded as one of the best in the new generation of fiddle players. Versatile and inventive, her fiddling style draws strongly from the Scottish tradition, but is in no way bound by it. An assistant professor at Berklee College of Music, Jenna performs as part of a duo with cutting edge harpist Mairi Chaimbeul and is the regular fiddler for the Seamus Egan Project. Newfoundland-born guitarist Keith Murphy is a rhythmic powerhouse on guitar and a traditional singer of rare finesse. A native of Newfoundland, he has lived in New England for many years where he has been an influential presence in the traditional music scene through his work with many respected bands, as a tune writer and as director of the Northern Roots Festival in Brattleboro, VT. He has four solo recordings of traditional songs, the most recent being Bright As Amber (2023). Together, the Hanneke Cassel Band creates a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition. Please note: All ticket sales are final. No refunds.",

With a voice that is raw and sultry and a style rooted in improvisation, her sets are a hypnotic and intimate journey. On her Signature Sounds Recordings debut ‚ÄôTil It‚Äôs Gone , McGuirk delivers a sublime set of songs that pairs her trademark soul sound with rootsy turns and raw rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll detours. The album landed on the Boston Globe‚Äôs Top 50 Albums list for 2022. Consequence of Sound raved, ‚Äú‚ÄòAll Back‚Äô feels like it could exist somewhere outside of space and time‚Äì it could be on a record in the background of a party in a 1970s bungalow, or it could be on your Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify. Either way, it‚Äôs a great listen.‚Äù McGuirk co-produced ‚ÄòTil It‚Äôs Gone with Jonah Tolchin (a star singer-songwriter in his own right) and a set of session legends: Little Feat guitarist/mandolinist Fred Tackett, organist Larry Goldings (James Taylor, Norah Jones), singer Valerie Pinkston (Ray Charles, Luther Vandross), percussionist Lenny Castro (Stevie Nicks, Stevie Wonder). They provided the astounding chops, but the true magic of the album comes from McGuirk‚Äôs singular voice as both singer and songwriter. The nine tracks run from intimate introspection to wider meditations on oppression and justice, from tough r&b and tender soul to big rock guitar and twangy folk. And McGuirk's voice ‚Äì bold, buttery, spellbinding ‚Äì carries each song to the next til they‚Äôre gone. Ali McGuirk",

        "location": "Boston University School of Theology 745 Commonwealth Avenue Boston, MA 02215 Show map",
        "about": "Boston University and The Journal of Religion & Film cordially invite you to The 2025 International Conference on Religion & Film to be held on the campus of Boston University School of Theology May 29-31, 2025 Theme‚ÄîReligion and Film: Conflict and Reconciliation Conflict and its resolution are at the heart of most movies. As Wes Anderson put it, ‚ÄúThere's no story if there isn‚Äôt some conflict.‚Äù From its beginnings, cinema has offered us compelling visions of interpersonal discord and international conflict, social struggle and division, terrorism and genocide‚Äîbut also stirring portrayals of reconciliation and forgiveness. Religion has often stood at the center of these stories, serving both as a source of conflict and division and a motivation and resource for peace, understanding, and healing. We invite papers that explore the role of religion in the cinematic construction of conflict and reconciliation, war and peace, hostility and forgiveness. How, for example, has religion been portrayed as instrumental in constructing violence as redemptive? Or how has religion been portrayed as offering a salvation that is achieved through suffering and violence? We are especially interested in scholarly discussion of films that highlight the ways religion has helped provide an imaginative vehicle or pathway for moving from conflict to reconciliation. General Call The International Conferences on Religion & Film are gatherings held to foster intellectual stimulation, build networks, and advance scholarship related to Religion and Film Studies. Every conference invites papers that explore the intersection of religion and film through the analysis of individual films, genre studies, religious themes in films, the representation of religion in film, and functionalistic approaches of film as religion. Although there is a thematic emphasis on our location this year in Boston, papers are not restricted to this theme, and we heartily welcome papers that include films from around the world and that consider the role of race and gender in the intersection of religion and film. Please submit a 350-word abstract of your proposal by January 30, 2025 to sthodaa@bu.edu with the subject line ‚Äú2025 International Conference on Religion & Film.‚Äù Please include 2 documents: 1) your anonymous 350-word abstract; 2) a document with your name and institution. Your abstract will undergo academic blind peer-review. Paper acceptances will be announced by March 1, 2025. From its early revolutionary history to conflicts around busing and desegregation, to the Boston Marathon bombing, Boston has seen its share of violence and conflict. But it is also a city that has been the home to peacemakers, such as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who earned his PhD at Boston University, and his mentor, Rev. Howard Thurman, former Dean of Boston University‚Äôs Marsh Chapel. The University is also home to the Howard Thurman Center for Common Ground and the Tom Porter Program on Religion and Conflict Transformation. We invite you to join us May 29-31, 2025 for a stimulating International Conference on Religion & Film! More details regarding conference schedule, discount hotel options, and tours including Boston‚Äôs historic ‚ÄúFreedom Trail,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack Heritage Trail,‚Äù and Boston Movie Tours will be published in late 2024. Discounted Early Bird registration deadline: March 15, 2025 Regular registration deadline April 15, 2025. Housing and other information can be found at the Conference website here For further questions you may contact Dr. Bryan Stone at bpstone@bu.edu .",

Website: itstarottime.com About the Show: Tarot‚Ä¶and comedy‚Ä¶together? Who would‚Äôve thought! Well‚Ä¶I did! I have been hosting and performing my shows for two and a half years now. It‚Äôs Tarot Time! is a fun and intimate space where participants come onstage to get a three card reading and I give them a bit of insight and sass. Part improv, part advice, all fun! My readings are described as ‚Äúcounseling with cards‚Äù, as they are more an opportunity and space for self-reflection and working towards a personal wholeness. I by the motto, ‚Äúthe cards tell you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear.‚Äù Any and all are welcome to come, as long as they are open-minded, ready to learn, have fun, and provide a safe space for all! Testimonials: ‚ÄúIt was a lot of fun! I was anxious at first, as it was my first reading and having my tarot read in front of a group seemed nerve racking, but the atmosphere as soon as the event started was friendly and you could tell everyone was there for a good time. It was definitely a night of laughs and I can‚Äôt wait to be back!‚Äù - Elvira T.L. ‚ÄúTarot Time was so much fun. It was a casual, inviting experience with some insightful and truly thoughtful readings! Plus, it was funny AF. 10/10! - Taylor M. ‚ÄúAt first I was a bit skeptical coming to one of these shows. I expected it to be one of those clich√© things you see on tv and only come for pure entertainment. I had just gotten back into tarot and was excited to hear what Antonio had to say. The show ended up being a great night with great laughs and jokes. He gave his audience a wonderful experience. He told me some things that rang true. I am so glad I cam and would definitely recommend!\"- Mekkailah C. \"Antonio‚Äôs Comedy Tarot was so much fun. It‚Äôs great entertainment for a night out with friends. My friend and I went with an open mind because we both love Tarot readings, but it was more than that. Antonio is a vibe! My reading also addressed what I was hoping to hear about. Pros: I can‚Äôt wait to go to my next show ‚ù§Ô∏è Cons: I had so much fun I would have stayed longer ‚ù§Ô∏è\" -Ali D. \"Imagine a long week, repetitive tasks day in and out, in the city of Boston, when you need to step out of your routine for a brief time to feel lighthearted and bubbly again, but without spending to much energy or money to add something to your planner that eventually would increase your stress level. That‚Äôs the time you need to come to Antonio. He will charm your heaviness away, bring back your playfulness, and in the middle of jokes and giggles, he will open your eyes to something about your life that you unintentionally, or maybe even intentionally, over looked at. Changes are possible, even for a life in Boston, even when endless repetitions of same tasks consumes our passions away, but Antonio will remind you of your own potentials with his tarot cards, and make you believe in your own power a little bit more. Wherever his show is at, there will be a breath of sweet fresh air in a dense heavy city night.\" - William W. About Antonio: Antonio Morales is a practicing tarot reader of 14 years and standup comedian. He does one-on-one sessions and public events/parties to provide insight to all who are interested. He uses his knowledge of the tarot, experience with reading people from all walks of life, and intuition to provide guidance to the querent (with some sass and comedic relief, of course >;P). He is also a standup comedian and host/producer of the show, The Boston Tee Hee Party, which can also be seen and experienced at Trident bookstore. Go figure!

As the community's hostility grows, Fahrije must navigate prejudice and threats to protect her livelihood and dignity. Set against the backdrop of a society grappling with trauma and gender norms, ‚ÄúHIVE‚Äù is a story of quiet resistance, resilience, and the pursuit of independence. The film made history by becoming the first Kosovan entry to win three major awards at the Sundance Film Festival in 2021: the Grand Jury Prize, the Audience Award, and the Directing Award in the World Cinema Dramatic category. It was also Kosovo's official submission for the Best International Feature Film at the 2022 Oscars. Following the screening, there will be an informal discussion where attendees are invited to share reflections and thoughts. Refreshments will be provided.",

In the working class city of Worcester, Massachusetts, Christine fights to regain custody of her young children while grappling with a traumatic past, and battling stigma from the very systems that are designed to help her. Bridget, who found recovery while in prison, now facilitates peer-led support meetings for women. On the frontlines, recovery coaches Janis and Rebecca navigate the city‚Äôs toughest corners offering support and trying to save lives. In this portrait of resilience, grit, and camaraderie, the women use their lived experience to lift up those still struggling while refusing to give up hope.

I was anxious at first, as it was my first reading and having my tarot read in front of a group seemed nerve racking, but the atmosphere as soon as the event started was friendly and you could tell everyone was there for a good time. It was definitely a night of laughs and I can‚Äôt wait to be back!‚Äù - Elvira T.L. ‚ÄúTarot Time was so much fun. It was a casual, inviting experience with some insightful and truly thoughtful readings! Plus, it was funny AF. 10/10! - Taylor M. ‚ÄúAt first I was a bit skeptical coming to one of these shows. I expected it to be one of those clich√© things you see on tv and only come for pure entertainment. I had just gotten back into tarot and was excited to hear what Antonio had to say. The show ended up being a great night with great laughs and jokes. He gave his audience a wonderful experience. He told me some things that rang true. I am so glad I cam and would definitely recommend!\"- Mekkailah C. \"Antonio‚Äôs Comedy Tarot was so much fun. It‚Äôs great entertainment for a night out with friends. My friend and I went with an open mind because we both love Tarot readings, but it was more than that. Antonio is a vibe! My reading also addressed what I was hoping to hear about. Pros: I can‚Äôt wait to go to my next show ‚ù§Ô∏è Cons: I had so much fun I would have stayed longer ‚ù§Ô∏è\" -Ali D. \"Imagine a long week, repetitive tasks day in and out, in the city of Boston, when you need to step out of your routine for a brief time to feel lighthearted and bubbly again, but without spending to much energy or money to add something to your planner that eventually would increase your stress level. That‚Äôs the time you need to come to Antonio. He will charm your heaviness away, bring back your playfulness, and in the middle of jokes and giggles, he will open your eyes to something about your life that you unintentionally, or maybe even intentionally, over looked at. Changes are possible, even for a life in Boston, even when endless repetitions of same tasks consumes our passions away, but Antonio will remind you of your own potentials with his tarot cards, and make you believe in your own power a little bit more. Wherever his show is at, there will be a breath of sweet fresh air in a dense heavy city night.\" - William W. About Antonio: Antonio Morales is a practicing tarot reader of 14 years and standup comedian. He does one-on-one sessions and public events/parties to provide insight to all who are interested. He uses his knowledge of the tarot, experience with reading people from all walks of life, and intuition to provide guidance to the querent (with some sass and comedic relief, of course >;P). He is also a standup comedian and host/producer of the show, The Boston Tee Hee Party, which can also be seen and experienced at Trident bookstore. Go figure!

We are excited to celebrate the hard work and struggle, the academic growth, the creation of new dreams, and the care for one another that this year‚Äôs incredible cohort of formerly incarcerated students has demonstrated. This graduation ceremony will include the fifth cohort of MyTERN students completing their undergraduate certificate in civic studies from Tufts: Luis Bizzarro, Jody Boykins, Todd Connelly, Sean Ellis, Rocio Lopez, Nathan Miksch, Elba Morales, Tari Richardson, Jason Stiles, and Chiteara Thomas. But after five years, we are now seeing the wild successes of students who continued in school after MyTERN! We will therefore celebrate five students earning their college degrees from different schools, including Tufts University, Boston College, Bunker Hill Community College, and North Shore Community College. Come and listen to students describe the challenges they faced during and after incarceration and the ways they navigate these. Students will discuss what people need post-incarceration not only to survive but also to thrive. And what does it mean to thrive? Yes to housing and yes to employment! But we need more than that as human beings building and rebuilding our selves and lives, relationships and communities. These graduates know it so well and their words always convey moving and powerful lessons. üçï There will be food downstairs after the ceremony at 8:00PM. To learn more about reentry and MyTERN, visit our website ; follow us on Instagram ; and listen to our podcast called MyTERN Conversations , on Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.

When Sophie and her two Jack Russell terriers move to Boston, she's excited not to be the only brown kid in the neighborhood anymore.

And Bonney needs surgery that Juno's family can't afford. So Sophie and Juno invent the Barking Puppy , the first ever newspaper written ‚Äúby dogs‚Äù and ‚Äúfor dogs.‚Äù Will anyone else get how funny it is? And more importantly, can they sell it to raise enough money in time to save Bonney? Will the landlord kick Sophie and her mom out before they even get started? Join us for a reading, signing, and Q&A with author Lori Lobenstine. Recommended for ages 7-12",

And now, after almost a decade of supporting each other through the publishing journey and through life‚Äôs ups & downs, they have 15 children‚Äôs books between them either published or under contract. Join us for a very special spring reading from Kari and Carrie from their new children‚Äôs books about making and nurturing friendships, Alfred Blooms by Carrie Kruck and Maddie & Mabel Make a Friend by Kari Allen. ALFRED BLOOMS by Carrie Kruck (illustrated by Carmen Mok) is a whimsical story of a boy named Alfred who is sure that if he can only grow a beautiful garden, new friends will flock to join him. He spends his days tending to his small patch of dirt, but despite all his efforts, neither flowers nor friendships will bloom. But when Alfred spills a pack of wildflower seeds and accidentally turns himself into a garden, he grows enough courage to share himself with the world and discovers that friendships, like flowers, can grow in surprising ways. MADDIE & MABEL MAKE A FRIEND by Kari Allen is the sixth book in the award-winning Maddie and Mabel K-3 chapter book series. Maddie and Mabel are sisters and best friends. But will their ‚Äúbest‚Äù be put to the test when a moving truck pulls up next door? A new friend is exciting at first. But soon it starts to feel like there is not enough room in the playing and laughing and secret-telling for more than two friends. Healing differences and growing friendships will take a lot of listening, curiosity, a little humor, and open hearts. Join us for a very special reading and flower garden craft activity with Kari and Carrie followed by a Q&A and signing!",

A curious girl visits the tree and plucks the largest, brightest hope she can find. Her hope can float, so she tethers it to her side and takes it with her everywhere. When the unimaginable happens and her hope is crushed, the girl pieces her hope back together and drags it along behind her until even the pieces are lost. Or are they? Looking back, she finds that small trees have begun to sprout in her wake, the beautiful offerings of her now firmly rooted, thriving hope. Join us for a story time reading, activity, and signing with author Allie Millington!",
