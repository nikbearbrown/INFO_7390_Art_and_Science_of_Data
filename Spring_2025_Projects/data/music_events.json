        "location": "Regent Theatre 7 Medford Street Arlington, MA 02474 Show map",
        "about": "PETER ASHER: A MUSICAL MEMOIR OF THE 60'S AND BEYOND ‚Äú‚Ä¶as Mr. Asher regaled a delighted audience with stories‚Ä¶ he conjured history in the making, before it was set in stone.‚Äù ‚Äì Stephen Holden, New York Times ‚Äú‚Ä¶the exuberant Mr. Asher knew anyone who rocked and everyone who mattered.‚Äù ‚ÄìWall Street Journal ‚ÄúAn all-around charming and delightful fellow ‚Äî he reminisces about his whole career and it is highly entertaining‚Äù ‚Äì Steve Martin ‚ÄúEverybody should go and see it ‚Äî I‚Äôve seen it myself twice‚Äù ‚Äì Linda Ronstadt \"The Man, The Myth, The Legend! ...and a true friend! Great wit and music. A true storyteller! What more could you possibly want? Don‚Äôt miss this!\"--Hans Zimmer We first came to know him through the global smash ‚ÄúWorld Without Love‚Äù as one half of the British Invasion duo Peter & Gordon. He returns--now a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire-- in ‚ÄúPeter Asher: A Musical Memoir of the 60s and Beyond‚Äù which brings a multimedia experience to the stage, hosted by the two-time Grammy winner for Producer of the Year. Peter Asher moved effortlessly from his role with Peter & Gordon to Music Executive with the Beatles‚Äô Apple Records, then famously- (as in cover of Rolling Stone magazine level famous)- to Producer and Manager, handling the careers of James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt and a host of others. Books abound, documentaries with half-truths (and worse) are all too common, but, now, finally, Mr. Asher tells first hand his tales from the eye of the cultural hurricane in this intimate evening. ‚ÄúMemoir‚Äù includes film footage and photos from Peter‚Äôs considerable personal archive, brought to life with a storyteller‚Äôs gift, transporting audiences back to the heart of 60s popular culture. Icons such as Mick Jagger, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Marianne Faithful, Yoko Ono, Carole King, James Taylor and Linda Ronstadt are among the cast of characters in this narrative ‚Äì along (of course) with the greatly missed Gordon Waller. The evening is filled with the music of Peter & Gordon, including ‚ÄúI Go to Pieces,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue Love Ways,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLady Godiva.‚Äù The songs given to Peter & Gordon by Paul McCartney are also front and center: ‚ÄúWoman,‚Äù ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Want to See You Again,‚Äù Nobody I Know,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWorld Without Love,‚Äù all of which were US Top 40 hits. Peter presents these timeless classics along with other old favourites from that golden era. The show brings the audience through the earliest days of Peter‚Äôs journey all the way to the present day, and projects including his SiriusXM radio show on the Beatles Channel, \"From Me to You\" . Peter's book based on the show, \"The Beatles A to Zed\" was released by MacMillan on October 29, 2019; the book is already in it's third printing. Peter remains a sought after producer, and Memoir delves into that part of his life as well. The Peter Asher-produced CD by Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers, \"The Long Awaited Album\", was released September 22, 2017, with a stand-alone single, \"California' released in January of 2020. They are among several production efforts Steve Martin has asked Mr. Asher to oversee, including a 2018 PBS TV special with Martin Short and the Steep Canyon Rangers. Covered also is Peter‚Äôs production of the ‚ÄúLove Has Come for You‚Äù CD by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell ‚Äî the title track a Grammy Winner in 2014- and the stage show based on it, ‚ÄúBright Star,‚Äù which garnered 5 Tony nominations in its run on Broadway in 2016. A project celebrating Elton John‚Äôs songwriting partnership with Bernie Taupin saw the light of day in 2018, \"Revamped\" ; among the highlights was Ed Sheeran's take on Candle in The Wind\", produced by Mr. Asher. The celebratory collection was a follow up to the Peter Asher-produced special edition of ‚ÄúGoodbye Yellow Brick Road‚Äù -released in March 2014 ‚Äì which featured Ed Sheeran, Imelda May, Fall Out Boy, and others covering songs from that classic album. Peter takes you behind the curtain of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, where he inducted two old friends, the Rolling Stones‚Äô first manager Andrew Loog Oldham and the Beatles‚Äô Manager Brian Epstein. The PBS special ‚ÄúBuddy Holly: Listen to Me -The Ultimate Buddy Party‚Äù is still being aired regularly, and its sister CD, ‚ÄúListen to Me: Buddy Holly‚Äù remains a favorite. His work on soundtracks (\"Amazing Spider-Man 2,‚Äù ‚ÄúMan Of Steel,‚Äù ‚ÄúRush.‚Äù, etc), alongside the legendary Hans Zimmer, is touched on also, as well as the 2017 \"Hans Zimmer Live!\" tour of the USA and Europe that Mr. Asher Directed. August 6, 2021 saw the release, on Compass Records' Red House imprint, the Peter Asher produced \"Why Wait!\" from Kate Taylor. James' \"Sister Kate\" is backed by Albert Lee, Danny Kortchmar, Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, Waddy Wachtel, Victoria Asher, Scarlet Rivera and more. Many of the same cast to worked on the new album by the Bangles' Susanna Hoffs, which Mr. Asher produced was released in 2023. Most recently, Peter and Walter Afanasieff co-produced Barbra Streisand's April 2024 release, ‚ÄòLove Will Survive,‚Äô the theme for Peacock Television‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Tattooist of Auschwitz‚Äô. Now, fifteen years on, ‚ÄúMemoir‚Äù continues to thrill, as the reviews attest. On a more personal note, friends such as Liza Minelli, Eric Idle, Paul Shaffer, Ray Davies, Bill Wyman, Ken Follett, Edie Brickell, Billy Connolly, Jeff Lynne, Paul Simon, Bob Balaban, Joan Collins, Steve Martin, Ed Sheeran, Tony Shalhoub, Linda Ronstadt, and Michael Feinstein have been among the audiences in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and London that have given standing ovations to ‚ÄúPeter Asher: A Musical Memoir of the 60s and Beyond.‚Äù TICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE",

Fronted by legendary songwriter Dennis Brennan, this powerhouse lineup features guitarist Andrew Stern, bassist Jim Haggerty, and drummer Chris Anzalone‚Äîall veterans of the local and national music scene. Originally a side project born during the pandemic, TrueVines has evolved into Brennan‚Äôs primary creative outlet, embracing a rougher, high-energy sound steeped in garage rock and soul. Their forthcoming six-song release captures the band‚Äôs unique chemistry: quick, raunchy originals that channel the raw spirit of the ‚Äô60s, soulful struts, and even a nod to their rootsy side with a country ballad. With shout-along choruses, swaggering guitars, and an unapologetic sense of fun, TrueVines proves that rock and roll is still very much alive. Guitarist Andrew Stern, originally from Illinois, honed his craft in Boston after stints in California and New York‚Äôs vibrant music scenes. He has worked across a range of styles with artists like Dennis Brennan, Mark Erelli, and Brian Carpenter and leads several projects, including his adventurous trio, AS3. Stern‚Äôs versatile and inventive guitar work is a cornerstone of TrueVines‚Äô sound. Bassist Jim Haggerty and drummer Chris Anzalone bring decades of experience as first-call studio musicians and live performers. Known for their dynamic and impeccable musicianship, they form the backbone of TrueVines, driving its raw and electric energy. Described by Mod Magazine as ‚Äústill in the attic or the garage, and loving every second of it,‚Äù TrueVines captures the freedom and vitality of a band playing for the sheer joy of it. TrueVines",

        "about": "$25 adv/$32 door Doors at 7 This album has been two years in the making and was born with the idea of balancing the scale. Following one of Massachusetts most notable Country artists directing their audience NOT to listen to Bruce Springsteen....Ward Hayden & the Outliers decided the best way to offset that negativity was to do something positive and delve into Springsteen‚Äôs epic catalog. Taking that journey with all its nostalgia, appreciation, and creativity is unequivocally positive. This album plays like a thank you note to The Boss, one that will resonate with Springsteen and Outliers fans alike. This collection of songs was chosen from the soundtrack to many people's lives who grew up in the 70s, 80s, & 90s. These are the songs that played while you hung out in your friend's kitchen, watched TV in your living room, drove your car home from school, or when you partied on the weekends. These songs earned their place in our lives, they've been there for us, they've been along for the ride. Ward Hayden & the Outliers NEW album \"Little by Little\" has taken the songwriting of Bruce Springsteen, channeled it through their country music filled hearts and minds, resulting in something extraordinary and unique. It's The Boss done Outliers-style. It's the music that's been our crutch to lean on, our shoulder to cry on, and the words that we sing out with joy at the top of our lungs. It's the music that taught us to love music, the music that makes us want to keep making more music, and it's meant to be shared. May 22nd & 23rd come celebrate the album release of ‚ÄúLittle By Little‚Äù by Ward Hayden & The Outliers. Ward Hayden & The Outliers",

        "about": "ABOUT HANNEKE CASSEL Effervescent and engaging, Boston-based fiddler Hanneke Cassel‚Äôs fiddle music fuses influences from the Isle of Skye and Cape Breton with Americana grooves and musical innovations. She has performed and traveled across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Hanneke‚Äôs music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional, described by the Boston Globe as ‚Äúexuberant and rhythmic, somehow wild and innocent, delivered with captivating melodic clarity and an irresistible playfulness.‚Äù The Hanneke Cassel Band features Jenna Moynihan on 5-string fiddle and Keith Murphy on guitar/vocals. Jenna Moynihan is regarded as one of the best in the new generation of fiddle players. Versatile and inventive, her fiddling style draws strongly from the Scottish tradition, but is in no way bound by it. An assistant professor at Berklee College of Music, Jenna performs as part of a duo with cutting edge harpist Mairi Chaimbeul and is the regular fiddler for the Seamus Egan Project. Newfoundland-born guitarist Keith Murphy is a rhythmic powerhouse on guitar and a traditional singer of rare finesse. A native of Newfoundland, he has lived in New England for many years where he has been an influential presence in the traditional music scene through his work with many respected bands, as a tune writer and as director of the Northern Roots Festival in Brattleboro, VT. He has four solo recordings of traditional songs, the most recent being Bright As Amber (2023). Together, the Hanneke Cassel Band creates a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition. Please note: All ticket sales are final. No refunds.",

        "about": "$25 adv/$32 door Doors at 7 This album has been two years in the making and was born with the idea of balancing the scale. Following one of Massachusetts most notable Country artists directing their audience NOT to listen to Bruce Springsteen....Ward Hayden & the Outliers decided the best way to offset that negativity was to do something positive and delve into Springsteen‚Äôs epic catalog. Taking that journey with all its nostalgia, appreciation, and creativity is unequivocally positive. This album plays like a thank you note to The Boss, one that will resonate with Springsteen and Outliers fans alike. This collection of songs was chosen from the soundtrack to many people's lives who grew up in the 70s, 80s, & 90s. These are the songs that played while you hung out in your friend's kitchen, watched TV in your living room, drove your car home from school, or when you partied on the weekends. These songs earned their place in our lives, they've been there for us, they've been along for the ride. Ward Hayden & the Outliers NEW album \"Little by Little\" has taken the songwriting of Bruce Springsteen, channeled it through their country music filled hearts and minds, resulting in something extraordinary and unique. It's The Boss done Outliers-style. It's the music that's been our crutch to lean on, our shoulder to cry on, and the words that we sing out with joy at the top of our lungs. It's the music that taught us to love music, the music that makes us want to keep making more music, and it's meant to be shared. May 22nd & 23rd come celebrate the album release of ‚ÄúLittle By Little‚Äù by Ward Hayden & The Outliers. Ward Hayden & The Outliers",

        "about": "$20 adv/$25 door Blending classic soul power with a folk songwriter lyricism, New England‚Äôs Ali McGuirk has the rare ability to silence a room with just a few words of a song. With a voice that is raw and sultry and a style rooted in improvisation, her sets are a hypnotic and intimate journey. On her Signature Sounds Recordings debut ‚ÄôTil It‚Äôs Gone , McGuirk delivers a sublime set of songs that pairs her trademark soul sound with rootsy turns and raw rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll detours. The album landed on the Boston Globe‚Äôs Top 50 Albums list for 2022. Consequence of Sound raved, ‚Äú‚ÄòAll Back‚Äô feels like it could exist somewhere outside of space and time‚Äì it could be on a record in the background of a party in a 1970s bungalow, or it could be on your Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify. Either way, it‚Äôs a great listen.‚Äù McGuirk co-produced ‚ÄòTil It‚Äôs Gone with Jonah Tolchin (a star singer-songwriter in his own right) and a set of session legends: Little Feat guitarist/mandolinist Fred Tackett, organist Larry Goldings (James Taylor, Norah Jones), singer Valerie Pinkston (Ray Charles, Luther Vandross), percussionist Lenny Castro (Stevie Nicks, Stevie Wonder). They provided the astounding chops, but the true magic of the album comes from McGuirk‚Äôs singular voice as both singer and songwriter. The nine tracks run from intimate introspection to wider meditations on oppression and justice, from tough r&b and tender soul to big rock guitar and twangy folk. And McGuirk's voice ‚Äì bold, buttery, spellbinding ‚Äì carries each song to the next til they‚Äôre gone. Ali McGuirk",

This years A Radical Welcome is titled Source Code, borrowed from Jessie Montgomery's composition of the same name which opens the program . The extraordinary energy within Source Code extends throughout the program which showcases five women composers including: Melanie Bonis (1858-1957) Amy Beach (1867-1944) Gabriela Lena Frank (b. 1972) Jessie Montgomery (b. 1981) Eleanor Alberga (b.1949) As audience participation is core to BPQ‚Äôs presentations, the musicians will moderate conversations with the concert-goers following each piece, getting to the bottom of where the music comes from and what it means to us. Don't miss out on this opportunity to be a part of a community that values inclusivity , diversity , and empowerment . Come and explore the S ource Code of a truly A R adical Welcome ! Featuring D √≠j √≠ Kay Known for his soulful tone and mesmerizing phrasing, Trevor James Alto Flute Artist D√≠j√≠ Kay (n√©e DeShaun Gordon-King) has given performances as a soloist and principal flute in Europe, Asia, and throughout the United States. D√≠j√≠ Kay grew up surrounded by griot traditions, jazz and gospel music. Inspired by the worlds and traditions of his upbringing, D√≠j√≠ Kay grew passionate about programming that blends them all together to create unique and memorable concert experiences. As he continued to expand his musical versatility, D√≠j√≠ Kay also went inward to cultivate his spiritual practice. It was through these meditations that he understood how he wanted to use his art. Following this epiphany, D√≠j√≠ Kay moved to Cambridge to pursue a Performance Diploma from the Longy School of Music where he worked with Sergio Pallottelli where he would also be able to study therapeutic music.

        "about": "$20 adv/$25 door Blending classic soul power with a folk songwriter lyricism, New England‚Äôs Ali McGuirk has the rare ability to silence a room with just a few words of a song. With a voice that is raw and sultry and a style rooted in improvisation, her sets are a hypnotic and intimate journey. On her Signature Sounds Recordings debut ‚ÄôTil It‚Äôs Gone , McGuirk delivers a sublime set of songs that pairs her trademark soul sound with rootsy turns and raw rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll detours. The album landed on the Boston Globe‚Äôs Top 50 Albums list for 2022. Consequence of Sound raved, ‚Äú‚ÄòAll Back‚Äô feels like it could exist somewhere outside of space and time‚Äì it could be on a record in the background of a party in a 1970s bungalow, or it could be on your Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify. Either way, it‚Äôs a great listen.‚Äù McGuirk co-produced ‚ÄòTil It‚Äôs Gone with Jonah Tolchin (a star singer-songwriter in his own right) and a set of session legends: Little Feat guitarist/mandolinist Fred Tackett, organist Larry Goldings (James Taylor, Norah Jones), singer Valerie Pinkston (Ray Charles, Luther Vandross), percussionist Lenny Castro (Stevie Nicks, Stevie Wonder). They provided the astounding chops, but the true magic of the album comes from McGuirk‚Äôs singular voice as both singer and songwriter. The nine tracks run from intimate introspection to wider meditations on oppression and justice, from tough r&b and tender soul to big rock guitar and twangy folk. And McGuirk's voice ‚Äì bold, buttery, spellbinding ‚Äì carries each song to the next til they‚Äôre gone. Ali McGuirk",
