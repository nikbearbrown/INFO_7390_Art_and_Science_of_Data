# Project Folder Naming Convention for Spring 2025 Projects

When adding your project to the Spring_2025_Projects folder at https://github.com/nikbearbrown/INFO_7390_Art_and_Science_of_Data/tree/main/Spring_2025_Projects, please use the following naming convention:

```
ProjectTitle_LastNames
```

Where:
- **ProjectTitle**: A clear, descriptive title for your project (2-5 words)
- **LastNames**: Last names of all team members, separated by underscores

Examples:
- `LiteratureReviewAssistant_Smith_Johnson_Davis`
- `StockMarketSentimentAnalyzer_Rodriguez_Chen`
- `PersonalizedStoryGenerator_Patel`
- `MedicalResearchCompanion_Washington_Zhang_Kumar`
- `FinancialNewsAnalyzer_Gonzalez`

## Additional Guidelines:
1. Use CamelCase for multi-word project titles (example: LiteratureReviewAssistant)
2. Keep folder names concise but descriptive
3. Ensure your project title clearly conveys the purpose of your application
4. Make sure your README.md clearly identifies all team members and their contributions
5. Individual submissions should follow the same format, just with a single last name

This naming convention will help organize projects while making it easy to identify team members and project topics at a glance.
