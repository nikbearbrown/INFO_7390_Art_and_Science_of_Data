##  About the Project

**Problem:**  
Scriptwriting and visual storyboarding are time-consuming and require professional expertise. Beginners, writers, and indie filmmakers often struggle to rapidly prototype ideas.

**Solution:**  
This app provides an AI-powered solution that takes your input (genres, characters, and premise) and automatically generates:
- A **5-page professional movie script**
- **Storyboard images** (one per page)
- **Voiceover narration** + **video** combining the storyboard and script

All **without coding or design skills**.
