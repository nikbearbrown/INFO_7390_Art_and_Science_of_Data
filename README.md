# INFO 7390: Advances in Data Sciences and Architecture

## 🔍 Course Description

**Garbage-In Garbage Out (GIGO)** is the most widely used maxim in machine learning, but how does one assess the quality of each step in an analysis pipeline? This course teaches students how to understand their data, models, and pipelines using **visualization** and **computational skepticism**, empowering them to create robust, trustworthy AI systems.

Throughout the semester, students move from high-level philosophy to building **agentic AI tools** that implement principles of computational skepticism to validate data, models, and analytical pipelines.

## 🛠️ Key Learning Pillars

* **AI Fluency & Botspeak:** Master the Nine Pillars of AI Fluency (Strategic Delegation, Critical Evaluation, Stochastic Reasoning, etc.) to optimize human-AI collaboration.
* **Computational Skepticism:** Develop systematic doubt in AI workflows using adversarial validation and critical thinking frameworks.
* **Visual Understanding & Design:** Learn to understand statistical properties visually, choose the right chart for the right question, and apply advanced visual design principles like rhythm, hierarchy, and unity.
* **Generative AI for Data:** Explore the creation and evaluation of high-quality synthetic data across text, numeric, image, audio, and video modalities.
* **Causal Inference:** Go beyond correlation by using Evidence Knowledge Graphs (EKG), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and counterfactual frameworks to identify true causal relationships.
