Question,Answer
"When did you start working in the stock market, and what was your first job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
How did your mathematical skills help you in your early career?,"My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately. In fact, I was so good with numbers that I completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school."
"When did you first become interested in the behavior of prices, and what sparked your curiosity?","I first became interested in the behavior of prices when I was fourteen years old. It started with my observations of price movements on the big board in the customers' room. I noticed that there were certain habits in advances and declines, which made precedents to guide me."
What role did your fondness for mental arithmetic play in your early days as a quotation-board boy?,"My fondness for mental arithmetic was extremely helpful. I could remember in detail how the prices had acted on the previous day, just before they went up or down. This skill allowed me to quickly post numbers on the big board and helped me to develop my interest in price behavior."
"What lessons did you learn from your early observations of the stock market, and how have they guided your approach over time?","I learned that there is nothing new in Wall Street, as speculation has been around for a long time. I also realized that whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again. These lessons have helped me to stay focused on understanding price behavior and making informed decisions."
"Can you explain what you mean by 'clocking' stocks, and how does this relate to anticipating movements in prices?","When I say 'clocked' stocks, I mean that I've noticed patterns and trends in their past performances. By carrying these observations in my mind, I can anticipate where the buying is outpacing the selling and where the price movement is likely to occur next. It's like having a telescope to read the tape and understand what's going on in the market."
How do you use your observations and experiences to make predictions about stock movements?,"I keep a little book of my hits and misses, where I record my observations and determine probable movements. I verify whether I'm right by checking with actual transactions from the tape."
"What is your approach when analyzing fluctuations in the market, and how do you use the tape to make decisions?","I look for patterns and associations in the fluctuations, focusing on upward or downward movements. The tape itself doesn't provide explanations for why a stock behaves in a certain way; it's up to me to act instantly based on what I see."
"What made you interested in a tip on Burlington from an office boy, and how did you approach the situation?","I was interested because he claimed that Burlington was going to go up, and I wanted to test my work on it. When he offered me a chance to invest with him, I saw it as an opportunity to see if my theory of reading the tape held true in practice."
"How did you respond when the office boy asked for your money to play the tip, and what was going through your mind at that moment?","I told him I wasn't interested in doubling my money, but rather in seeing if his claim about Burlington's price movement was correct. I looked up the information in my little dope book to verify his statement."
"At what age did you start working in the stock market, and what was your first job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did you initially start trading and speculating in the bucket shops, and what drove your passion for it?","After my first trade, I got to speculating on my own hook in the bucket shops. I'd go during my lunch hour and buy or sell—it never made any difference to me. I was playing a system and not a favorite stock or backing opinions. All I knew was the arithmetic of it."
"How did having more margin affect your trading strategy, and what drove your confidence in your system?","Having more margin meant to me that I could be right more emphatically. More courage? No! If all I have is ten dollars and I risk it, I am much braver than when I risk a million, if I have another million salted away."
How did you handle situations where bucket shops were suspicious of your trading tactics?,"I'd start by losing on purpose to gain their trust, and then I'd make a profit when they least expected it. This allowed me to build credibility with them, but eventually, they'd become too expensive for me to continue doing business with."
What was the nickname given to you by the bucket shops due to your trading abilities?,"They started calling me the 'Boy Plunger' because I could consistently beat their predictions and gain profits, which made them lose money on our trades."
"How did you deal with bucket shops, and what happened when they discovered your true identity?","I had to be constantly moving from one bucket shop to another, using a fictitious name. I'd start with small trades, but if the owners suspected me of being the Boy Plunger, I'd intentionally lose money at first and then make big gains. Eventually, they'd find me too expensive, but some shops didn't refuse my business due to sportsmanship concerns."
What happened when you tried to open an account with a Cosmopolitan Stock Brokerage Company branch?,"I went to several branches, but they all got to know me and refused my trading. They'd crack jokes about me, making it impossible for me to trade at long intervals by dividing my visits among them. Eventually, I found one last branch that took my trading, but even they eventually turned against me."
"When did you try to diversify your trading by visiting multiple bucket shops, and what was the outcome?",I tried to get them to let me trade at long intervals by dividing my visits among them all. But that didn't work. Finally there was only one left to me and that was the biggest and richest of all the Cosmopolitan Stock Brokerage Company.
"How did the Cosmopolitan Stock Brokerage Company change your trading terms, and what effect did this have on your ability to trade?","They made me put up a three point margin and compelled me to pay a premium at first of a half point, then a point, and finally, a point and a half. Some handicap, that! How? Easy! Suppose Steel was selling at $90 and you bought it. Your ticket read, normally: ""Bot Steel at 90-⅛."" If you put up a point margin it meant that if it broke 89 -¼ you were wiped out automatically."
"How did you trade in bucket shops, and what were some of the limitations?","You gave your money to a clerk and told him what you wished to buy or sell. He looked at the tape or the quotation board and took the price from there—the last one, of course. When you wished to close your trade, you went to the clerk—the same or another, it depended on the shop—and told him. He wrote that price and the time on your ticket, O.K.'d it and gave it back to you, and then you went to the cashier and got whatever cash it called for."
"What was unique about the Cosmopolitan people's approach to trading, and how did you take advantage of it?","The Cosmopolitan put no limit on a trade, which meant I could buy or sell as much as they'd let me. They also had thousands of patrons, and I think I was the only man they were afraid of. Neither the killing premium nor the three-point margin reduced my trading much."
"What were some of the risks involved in trading with bucket shops, especially when the market went against you?","When the market went against me and the price went beyond the limit set by my margin, my trade automatically closed itself and my ticket became one more scrap of paper. In humbler bucket shops, people were allowed to trade in as little as five shares, and the shops would deduct both buying and selling commissions."
"When did you first accumulate ten thousand dollars in cash, and how did your mother react to this amount of money?","I accumulated ten thousand dollars in cash when I was only twenty years old. My mother reacted with skepticism, telling me that having such a large amount of money was unusual and that I should be satisfied with my earnings and not pursue 'gambling' by investing."
"How did the bucket shops make their profit, according to Jesse Livermore, and how did this impact his trading?","The bucket shops made their profit by deducting both buying and selling commissions from customers. They would charge a killing premium and three-point margin, which forced traders like me to put up more money to cover potential losses. This didn't significantly affect my trading, as I was able to buy and sell as much as they'd let me, often having lines of 5,000 shares."
"How did you feel about the market behavior, and what made you uncomfortable?","I felt that something was wrong somewhere, but I couldn't spot it. That being the case, I'd better be out of the market. I didn't do things blindly; I like to know why I'm doing something. But this time, I had no definite reason to give myself, and yet I was so uncomfortable that I couldn't stand it."
What did you decide to do when you felt uncomfortable in the market?,"I called a fellow named Dave Wyman and asked him to wait before calling out the next price of Sugar. Then, I walked over to the counter to where the clerk was, but I didn't really know why I should get out of the market, so I just stood there with my tickets in hand."
"What happened when you heard the telegraph instrument click, and how did it affect your decision?","I felt that something crooked was hatching, and I decided not to wait any longer. Just then, Dave Wyman called out the price of Sugar, and before he finished, I slapped my tickets on the counter in front of the clerk and yelled 'Close Sugar!' The house had to close my Sugar at the last quotation."
"When I slapped my tickets on the counter and yelled 'Close Sugar!' before Dave had finished calling the price, what happened next?","The house had to close my Sugar at the last quotation, which turned out to be $103 again. The telegraph instrument was going mad, and Tom Burnham, the clerk, was listening to it as if he were waiting for something."
What was the practice of bucket shops doing when they found themselves loaded with too many long positions on a certain stock?,"They would run down the price of that particular stock far enough to wipe out all the customers who were long of it, often by just a couple of points on a few hundred shares."
What did Henry Williams and I discover about our Sugar positions when we saw the price jump from $103 to $108?,"We discovered that there was a put-up job, and that bucket shop had our margin. This meant they had enough money to make a sharp drop in the market and wipe us out."
"How did you get caught by another operator, and what were the consequences?","I got caught by a New York operator who had been a bear in the 1896 Bryan panic. He sent thirty-five men to act as customers and bid up the price of a certain stock three or four points. My agents at the bucket shops cashed in as prearranged, but the operator's scheme was eventually exposed, and he cleaned up seventy thousand dollars net."
"What was your experience with the Cosmopolitan, and how did it affect you?","The Cosmopolitan's brokers ran up the price of a certain stock to wipe out all the customers who were long on it. This happened just ten days after I had lost money due to their manipulation. It was a frustrating experience, but it ultimately made me more cautious in my dealings with bucket shops."
"How did you make money from bucket shops, and what stocks did you like to manipulate?","I made money by cashing in at prearranged times, and my favorite stock was Western Union. I'd buy it at a certain price, sell it for a two-point profit, go short, and take three more points."
"What happened to the man who originated these bucket shop schemes, and how did his story end?","The originator of those schemes died poor and obscure. If he had lived until 1896, he would have likely gotten a significant newspaper mention."
What motivated you to leave Boston and head to New York to trade in the stock market?,"I wanted to be close to the original source of quotes, as I didn't want any Boston branch where quotations had to be telegraphed. I wanted to work directly from the New York Stock Exchange."
How did you handle the Cosmopolitan Stock Brokerage Company's attempts to beat you by foul means?,"I soon made up my mind to go to New York after they threatened to beat me, and I came at the age of 21 with all $25 in hand. I was determined to stick to my trading plan, which I believed was sound enough."
What was your overall success rate if you had stuck to your original trading plan?,"If I had stuck to it, I'd have been right perhaps as often as seven out of ten times. However, I didn't always win, and my plan wasn't infallible."
What made you decide to leave Boston and head to New York at the age of 21?,"I didn't want any Boston branch, where the quotations had to be telegraphed. I wanted to be close to the original source."
How did your tendency to wait for the right moment to make a trade affect your success in trading?,"I would have been right perhaps as often as seven out of ten times if I had stuck to my own game—that is, to play the market only when I was satisfied that precedents favored my play."
What do you believe is the main reason why many men in Wall Street fail to succeed?,"There is the plain fool, who does the wrong thing at all times everywhere, but there is the Wall Street fool, who thinks he must trade all the time. No man can always have adequate reasons for buying or selling stocks daily or sufficient knowledge to make his play an intelligent play."
How did your experience with bucket shops impact your approach to trading?,I let the craving for excitement get the better of my judgment. In a bucket shop where your margin is a shoestring you don't play for long pulls. You are wiped too easily and quickly.
"When did you first start trading, and what was your initial experience like?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did your success in the bucket shops influence your trading style, and what were some of its limitations?","My remarkable success in the bucket shops allowed me to beat the game my way exclusively. I could bet on fluctuations and follow up my luck or cut my loss quickly. However, this style was only possible in a bucket shop environment, where I had an advantage due to my tape reading skills."
How did your success in bucket shops affect your trading strategy in a traditional stock exchange house?,"My remarkable success in the bucket shops was my downfall. In those places, I could beat the game by betting on fluctuations. However, when I transitioned to a traditional stock exchange house like A.R. Fullerton's office, the tape always talked ancient history to me because my system didn't account for the complexities of floor trading."
What was the main difference between your strategy in bucket shops and those in traditional stock exchange houses?,"In a bucket shop, I could move quickly and adapt to fluctuations. However, in A.R. Fullerton's office, even my big orders would tend to depress the price because I was trading on the floor, where I couldn't see the real prices until after they had been set."
How did your system of trading in a bucket shop prepare you for success in traditional stock exchange houses?,"My ability to read the tape and make quick decisions was supposed to help me succeed, but it ultimately didn't. I might have done better if I had been on the floor myself, where I could adapt my strategy to the immediate conditions."
"When did you realize that there was something wrong with your trading system, and what led you to this realization?","It didn't take me long to realise that there was something wrong with my play. I knew a part of the game of stock speculation, but if with all I had still lost, what chance does the green outsider have of winning?"
"What challenges did you face in your early trading days, and how did they affect your performance?","I faced a lot of challenges. I didn't know the game of stock speculation, and my system would fail me because of the effect of my own trading on prices. My orders would also depress the price when I sold."
"How did you feel about your losses, and what was your attitude towards the stock market?","I never lose my temper over the stock market. I never argue with the tape. Getting sore at the market doesn't get you anywhere. But deep down, I knew there wasn't anything wrong with me; only with my play."
"When did you start trading actively, and what were your losses due to it?","After six months of active trading, I lost all I had brought in, all that I had made, and even owed the firm a few hundred dollars. I was flat broke, but I knew there wasn't anything wrong with me; only with my play."
"Why did you approach your boss, A.R., for a loan to continue trading, and what were his initial conditions?","I asked A.R. for a loan of $500 so I could get back into the game and make some money. He initially offered me a credit, but I declined, saying I didn't want it. Instead, he agreed to lend me the money with one condition: I had to maintain a 10% margin on my shares."
"What was your plan after being rejected by A.R., and why did you choose St. Louis as your destination?","I decided to go to St. Louis because there were two concerns there that did an enormous business in the Middle West, with huge profits and no qualms about trading openly. I had heard that these concerns ran smoothly and attracted top traders without any hesitation."
When did you decide to go to St. Louis and start working in the bucket shops?,"I went to St. Louis after some thinking, with $500 to bring back a stake to use as margin in the office of A. R. Fullerton & Co."
"How did you plan to approach trading in the bucket shops, and what were your concerns about being recognized?","I was going to play it safe and conservatively, beating the system without getting caught by recognizing me as the 'Boy Trader'. I stood a better chance of being unnoticed in the crowd."
"What did you do when you walked into the J. G. Dolan Company bucket shop, and how did you try to blend in?","I walked in and looked around until I picked out a stock for my initial play, then approached the order- clerk at the window where people trade in cotton and wheat."
"How much money were you willing to invest initially, and how did the order-clerk respond?","I was willing to invest $100, which is what I asked about buying for. The clerk told me that if I had the cash, he could buy stocks for me."
"When you first started trading, did you have a specific stock or market in mind, and how did you find out about trading stocks?","No, until I picked out the stock for my initial play. I looked around and saw the order-clerk at the window where you put down your money and get your ticket."
"How did you buy your first stock, and what was the process like?","I walked up to him and asked, 'Is this where you trade in cotton and wheat?' He said yes, and I asked how much stock I could buy for $100. He told me one hundred shares if I had the cash, and I bought two hundred shares of Omaha stock."
"What was your experience like when you traded several times on the first day, and did you achieve your initial goal?","I got quick action and I traded several times that day. In two days, I made twenty-eight hundred dollars, and I was hoping they'd let me finish the week out."
"When did your luck change, and what prompted you to buy more stocks?","At the rate I was going, that wouldn't be so bad. Then I'd tackle the other shop, and if I had similar luck there I'd go back to New York with a wad I could do something with."
"How did you feel when you were summoned to see your boss, Dolan, on the third day, and what happened during that meeting?","On the morning of the third day, when I went to the window, bashful—like, to buy five hundred B.R.T. the clerk said to me, 'Say, Mr. Kent, the boss wants to see you.' When I was summoned to see Dolan, he asked me what I wanted to see him about, and I told him my last hope vanished."
"What was your reaction when you went to Dolan's place and found out he wanted to see you, and what did he say to you?","I knew the game was up. When I went in, Dolan said, 'Sit down, Livingston.' He pointed to a chair. My last hope vanished. He then told me that he didn't have anything to show me, but rather that I had taken something from him - twenty-eight hundred dollars worth of bets. He made it clear that I wasn't welcome here anymore."
"How did Dolan describe you to the clerk, and what was his reaction when he found out who you were?","Dolan described me as a 'ringer' - someone who is pretending to be something they're not. He had already suspected that I was one, but after finding out my true identity, he let the clerk know that he thought I was a fake, saying 'Ringer my eye, boss! His name is Horace Kent, and he's a rah-rah boy playing at being used to long pants.'"
"How did you decide to approach trading with your initial $28,800, and what were your concerns about trading at Teller's bucket shop?","I decided to start moderately and work up to a thousand shares, but I was also considering a plunge to take advantage of the potential profit. However, I was cautious because if they got suspicious or too many customers were long of that stock, they might not let me trade at all. So, I scattered my trades at first and began small."
"What happened when you tried to buy shares from the clerk at Teller's bucket shop, and how did the situation unfold?","The red-headed man refused to sell me any shares, telling me to leave Dolan's place. He said we didn't want my business and that I should understand. The other clerks also seemed unwelcome, so I decided it wasn't worth getting into an argument or trying to argue with them."
When did you leave Fullerton's office and what was the reason for your departure?,"I left Fullerton's office after he wouldn't let me make even one trade, despite having recently received a large sum of money from my friend A. R. Some fellow had told him that I couldn't be trusted with his business."
Who introduced you to old McDevitt and what did they talk about?,"An old jigger named McDevitt was introduced to me by someone who claimed to have known A. R. We talked about a group of Western racetrack crooks who had pulled off a skin game in St. Louis, with the leader being H. S. Teller, a poolroom owner."
What was your initial reaction when you found out that Teller had opened a bucket shop in Hoboken?,"I thought he meant a pool room, but McDevitt told me it was actually a bucket shop. I had heard about the reputation of such places and knew they were trouble."
"When I went to McDevitt's Teller shop in Hoboken, what did I expect to find, and why?",I expected to find a bucket shop where people could bet heavily on the market without risking much. I wanted to settle a grievance with Teller.
"What was the plan of McDevitt's Teller shop, according to him, and how did it seem to me?","According to McDevitt, the shop would allow customers to bet heavily on the market without risking much, with one-point margins. To me, that sounded like a recipe for easy profits."
"What was the atmosphere like at McDevitt's Teller shop when I visited, and what did the manager tell me?","The atmosphere was lively, with a big customers' room and a special policeman. The manager told me that the stock-market game was safer than betting at the track, and that some of their customers made significant profits."
"How did you make such a large profit with just $2000, and what made you choose those specific stocks?","I put up two thousand dollars in cash, and I picked the right stocks. The traders hammered the stocks in which they figured they would uncover the most stops, and sure enough, prices slid off. I closed out my trades just before the rally of the last five minutes on the usual traders' covering."
"When did you plan to get your money back from Teller, and what was the amount?","I planned to cash in my tickets on Monday morning, and I wanted the office to hold onto all the money until then. I said I'd be there Monday morning, sure as blazes."
"What happened when you arrived at Teller's office on Monday, and how did the St. Louis man react?","When I got to Teller's office, the manager handed me two thousand dollars in cash, along with four five-hundreds and three hundreds. The St. Louis man, who was there investigating, tried to scare me away by saying his boss had told them not to do business with me."
"How did you respond to the St. Louis man's attempts to intimidate you, and what was his change of heart?","I stood my ground and told him I wouldn't be intimidated. He started getting all fussy and tried to appeal to me, saying that if he had a heart, he'd do us a favor and let me trade there. But once he realized the situation wasn't going in his favor, he changed his tune quickly."
What was your experience like working as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office right after grammar school?,I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did your experiences with bucket shops in St. Louis influence your approach to trading, and what changes did you make when moving to other offices?","I'd got some money out of them for the way they treated me in St. Louis. There wasn't any sense in my getting hot or trying to close them up. I went back to Fullerton's office and told McDevitt that if it was agreeable to him, I'd like to have him go to Teller's place and begin trading in twenty or thirty share lots, to get them used to him."
"When did you stop trading with bucket shops, and what led you to do so?","I stopped trading with them because they refused to take my business on Election Day in 1900. If it wasn't for that, I probably wouldn't have learned the true nature of the game."
What were some restrictions on stocks that bucket shops would allow customers to trade in?,"Bucket shops used to limit the profit on certain stocks, like sugar and Tennessee Coal and Iron, to just two points. They didn't want their customers getting too big of a risk, with odds as high as 3 to 1 against McKinley winning the election."
How did you feel about the bucket shops' refusal to take your business on Election Day?,"To be honest, it was a blessing in disguise. If they hadn't refused my orders, I might not have discovered that there's more to stock speculation than just playing for small point fluctuations."
"When did you first learn about the concept of buying low and selling high, and how did it impact your trading approach?","I learned that I could make a profit by buying stocks on Monday when the election odds were 3 to 1 in favor of McKinley. If I had waited until Election Day to buy, I would have lost money because the shops refused to take orders on certain stocks. This taught me that there was more to stock speculation than just playing for small point fluctuations."
"How do you think conducting imaginary operations in the stock market can lead to success, and what's the difference between this approach and actual trading?","Conducting imaginary operations with fake money can be very easy and appealing, but it's not the same as real trading. It's like being a good shot at a duel - you might think you're skilled, but until you face reality, you don't know how you'll really perform."
When did you realize the importance of believing in yourself and your judgment to succeed in stock speculation?,I learned it the hard way - through experience. It took me five years to learn to play the game intelligently enough to make big money when I was right.
"What is your approach to receiving tips from other people, and how do you decide whether a tip is reliable or not?","I don't believe in tips. If I buy stocks on someone else's tip, I must sell those same stocks on the same tip. I am depending on them, and that's a recipe for disaster. Nobody can give me a tip or a series of tips that will make more money for me than my own judgment."
"How did you initially get into trading, and what was your first experience with trading in New York?",I went to work when I was just out of grammar school. I got a job as quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures. At school I did three years of arithmetic in one. I was particularly good at mental arithmetic. As quotation-board boy I posted the numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did your experience in bucket shops influence your trading style when you started working for Harding Brothers, and what made you think it would work in New York?","I didn't explain to you how natural it was for me to trade there exactly as I had done in the bucket shops, where all I did was to bet on fluctuations and catch small but sure changes in prices. Nobody offered to point out the essential differences or set me right."
"What skills or traits do you believe were most valuable for your success as a trader, according to you?","My tape-reading ability and training of my memory have been extremely valuable. Both of these things came easy to me. I owe my early success as a trader to them and not to brains or knowledge, because my mind was untrained and my ignorance was colossal."
"What happened on your first day as a customer at the reputable Stock Exchange house, and how did it reflect on your trading strategy?","On my first day, I traded in eleven hundred shares of stock, jumping in and out. The net result was that I lost exactly eleven hundred dollars. It showed me that something was wrong with the machine, but I couldn't see what it was."
How did you feel about your trading strategy after experiencing a significant loss on your first day?,"I didn't worry much about it because I couldn't see where there was anything wrong with me. My moves were right enough, and if I had been trading in the old Cosmopolitan shop, I'd have broken better than even."
"How did you initially approach trading, and what led you to realize that your method wasn't working?","I traded using the ticker, but I soon realized it wasn't helping me as it should. After a few days, I told myself, 'I can't trade this way here.' However, I didn't dig deeper and instead continued with my current approach until I got cleaned out."
"What changes did you make to your trading strategy after getting support from Fullerton, and what were the results?","After being staked by Fullerton for $500 42, I played more carefully and did better. As soon as I was in easy circumstances, I began to live well, made friends, and had a good time."
"What was your experience like when you started working in the stock market, and what was your first job?",I went to work right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did you initially approach trading, and what made you bearish on certain stocks during the boom?","Everybody was making money, but I knew there had to be a limit. When I sold, I lost money, so I played it safe by buying and selling short. I looked for a break, but I wasn't profiting as much as I should have been."
"What stock did you hold onto despite everyone's advice to sell, and what was the outcome?","I held onto Northern Pacific common, which had most stocks bought to a standstill. When it reached $110, I grabbed it and made a 30-point profit, accumulating nearly $50,000 in my account."
"What was your experience like when you first started working in the stock market, and what was your first job?",I went to work right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did you prepare for your next big move, and what were your expectations based on market trends?","I had been very bearish for some days, and here was my chance at last. I knew that we would have an opportunity to catch them coming and going, not only for big money but for sure money."
"What happened during the famous corner in May 1901, and how did it affect you personally?","The famous corner followed. After the market closed on May 8, 1901, everything happened as I had foreseen. The market fairly boiled, and the transactions were enormous. However, I was dead right, but I lost every cent I had! I was wiped out by something that was unusual."
"What was your experience like when you started trading, and what was your first job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did you feel when your trades were executed, and what led to your decision to cover your shorts?","When I saw that my stocks had sold at prices far lower than I had expected, it seemed like I was selling high. The market wasn't going to drop all the way down, so I decided to cover my shorts and go long."
"What did you learn from your experience with tape reading, and how did it affect your trading strategy?",I learned that relying solely on the ticker was not enough. The divergence between printed and actual prices undid me. I should have seen both my trouble and the remedy for it earlier.
"What was your approach to trading, and how did you adapt it during times of rapid market fluctuations?","I never traded with a limit; instead, I took my chances with the market. My adherence to the principle of speculation saved me, as it allowed me to adapt to changing market conditions."
How did your approach to trading change after realizing that tape reading was not enough to beat the market?,"I realized I needed to anticipate what would happen in a big way, rather than just trying to limit my losses with pike bets. This was a major shift for me and it took me years to figure out this new approach."
What ultimately led you to leave New York and try something else after multiple failed trading attempts?,"I got so sick of the game that I could no longer beat it, and to be honest, my losses were starting to outweigh my winnings. I had been trading since I was 14 and had made a lot of money, but not enough to sustain myself for much longer."
"What made you leave New York after getting cleaned out again, and what motivated you to try something else?","I was sick of the game and couldn't beat it anymore. I had been trading since my fourteenth year and had already made a good amount of money, but I was determined to find another way to make a living."
How many times did you lose a ten-thousand-dollar stake before returning to New York?,"More than once. I'd make and lose large sums of money in New York, but it was nothing new for me at that point."
"When did you first start trading, and what was your first significant profit?","I started trading when I was fourteen years old. My first thousand dollars came in when I was fifteen, making me a kid millionaire."
"Why did you leave New York to try something else, but ultimately returned to Wall Street?","I got sick of the game and couldn't beat it anymore, so I decided to leave. However, as soon as I was back home, I knew that my only mission in life was to get a stake and return to Wall Street."
What did you do when trying to get back into the bucket shops after leaving New York?,"I tried to get back into the bucket shops, but they didn't want to give me a chance. I told them the truth about my losses and lack of knowledge, but they wouldn't let me trade with them."
"When did I need to find a place to trade heavily, and why was it difficult to get back into bucket shops?","I needed to find a place to trade heavily when my game was all right, but I had little hope of getting in. The bucket shops were unreliable, and those who remembered me wouldn't give me a chance to show them whether I had gone back as a trader or not."
"Why did the office refuse to take my friend's small selling order for St. Paul shares, and what happened next?","The office refused to take my friend's small selling order because it was considered too small by their standards, with twenty shares being a reasonable amount for a gentleman to buy if they suspected they were going to guess right. When my friend tried to sell a hundred St. Paul shares, the clerk told him that 'nothing doing' and wouldn't accept the sale."
What was the outcome when one of the customers saw us talking outside the office and went in to report it?,"When one of the customers saw us talking together outside, they went into the office and told Joe, the order clerk. When my friend tried to sell a hundred St. Paul shares, Joe refused to accept the sale, saying 'nothing doing'. The other customers got involved, wanting to get a line on the merits of the case, and I was looking unconcerned while my friend looked indignant."
"What made you start working in the stock market right after grammar school, and what was your first job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How do you think the execution of brokers affects the traders, and what would make trading easier?","The execution from my brokers is the biggest obstacle to making money in this game. When a man gives an order to buy at the market, he never knows what that stock is going to cost him until he gets a report from the brokers. There are more moves of one or two points than of ten or fifteen. But the outside trader can't catch the small rises or drops because of the execution. I'd rather trade in a bucket shop any day."
"What made you stop spending your money at the office, and did you have to make new plans for using your funds?","My friend Livingston was around, and that stopped my board money. But I had made a few hundred more than I had spent, so I needed to figure out how to use them to make enough money to go back to New York."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did it relate to your mathematical skills?","I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room. My quick grasp of figures was a real asset, and my mental arithmetic skills helped me post numbers rapidly and accurately."
Can you explain how the New York Stock Exchange firms handle small orders and out-of-town business?,"These firms were very careful and paid special attention to the execution. They had confidential connections with the biggest and smartest houses on the New York Stock Exchange, and through their personal pull and guaranteeing a business of hundreds of thousands of shares a month, they got much better service than an individual customer could get."
"How do wire houses charge commissions for out-of-town business, and what kind of accounts are exempt from this additional commission?","They charge a thirty-second extra, in addition to the eighth commission. They only charge this extra commission in unusual cases, when the customer has an inactive account."
"When did you know that this person was touting for some phony brokers, and how did you respond?","I knew he was touting for phony brokers by the time we were discussing reliable houses. I asked him if he knew of any trustworthy brokerage firm, which made him introduce himself as a representative of the biggest brokerage firm in the United States."
"What do you think about the claims of this person and his firm, specifically regarding their ability to guarantee profits for customers?","I'm skeptical about the claims made by this person. He assured me that they have correspondents everywhere and memberships in all exchanges, but he also admitted that nobody living can guarantee how the market will be or how close the ticker's prices are to actual floor prices. I think it's unlikely that anyone can predict market movements with certainty."
"When I first started working in the stock market, what was my initial role, and how did I handle numbers?",I went to work right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"What type of firms were my future business partners and colleagues, and how did they operate?","They were one of the oldest of that class of firms - bucket shops disguised as regular brokers. They used elaborate camouflage to convince the world they were legitimate, but their methods were the same as those that went broke this year."
What made you skeptical about the tout's firm and their business practices?,"I'm sore on all brokers, which means they've wronged me in some way. I'll have to think this over before we can continue our conversation."
"How did the tout's firm handle customer orders, particularly when it came to buying and selling stocks?",They would buy and sell a large quantity of stock through a reputable Stock Exchange firm and get regular reports on it. They also formed discretionary pools in the office and allowed customers to authorize them to trade with their money and in their name.
"What was unusual about the tout's firm, according to you?","They were always on the make, first, last, and all the time. They specialized in trimming suckers who wanted to get rich quick, but they always asked their customers' permission, in writing, to take their rolls away from them."
"How did you initially approach trading with this firm, and what were your goals?","I made up my mind that I would see what trading advantages this firm offered over the legitimate brokers. Since I didn't have much money to put up as margin, firms that bucketed orders were naturally more liberal in that respect. This meant a few hundred dollars went much further in their offices."
What was your attitude towards the business practices of this firm compared to others you had encountered?,I wasn't concerned with the business ethics of this firm. I told you I felt sore on the Teller concern and how it tickled me to get even with them. But I didn't have any such feeling about this firm. They might be crooks or they might not be as black as they were painted.
"What was your initial goal when you visited a bucket shop, and how much money did they offer as margin?","I wanted to see what trading advantages this firm offered over legitimate brokers. They were more liberal with their margin, so a few hundred dollars went much further in their offices."
"What kind of market conditions made you think it was a good time to get involved with this bucket shop, and why did the manager want you to open an account?","It was a dull market with prices seesawing slightly, just the kind to get customers in and then wipe them out with a sharp drive in the tipped stock. The manager wanted me to open an account because it was a good market for them; they had high hopes of making money off customers."
How did the bucket shop's reputation as a place where you could trade at the next quotation affect your decision to open an account?,"They were famous for their execution, and if there was any difference between the ticker price and the report, it was always in favor of the customer. That meant I could trade there as though I were in a bucket shop—let me trade at the next quotation."
"When I first started working in the stock market, what was my initial job, and how did it help me develop skills that would benefit me later?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did my mathematical skills, particularly mental arithmetic, help me in my early career and trading?","My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately."
"What was your experience like working in bucket shops, and how did you adapt to win in this game?","I went into bucket shops, which were essentially trading in a slower pace than the normal market. It was a game I could beat, and I did. I never got it down to a fine point where I'd win ten times out of ten, but I won overall, taking it week in and week out."
"How did your brokers react when you accused them of being short sports or worse, and what was the outcome?","My brokers tried to double-cross me with old tricks a couple of times. They caught me because I wasn't looking, but they always denied it. When it happened, they'd forgive me as long as I didn't stop doing business with them. It's all about meeting you halfway and being magnanimous."
"When did you first start using this tactic with your brokers, and what was the goal behind it?","I decided to teach them a lesson after a crook tricked me. I started giving out buying orders on inactive stock to my five bucketeering brokers, then sent in an order to sell those shares at market price, which they'd have to pay for their own trades."
"How did you use this tactic to your advantage, and what was the outcome?","I made sure my wire house bought back the hundred shares I sold at a high price, resulting in a sharp advance. Meanwhile, my brokers had to buy those same shares at market price, making it a profitable deal for me."
How did your brokers react when they realized they'd been taken advantage of by this tactic?,"They were sore and began saying things over the wires. They had varying amounts of stock, which made it difficult for them to keep up with me."
"What was your ultimate goal in using this tactic, and how did it contribute to your future plans?",I wanted to prevent crooks' tricks from impairing my stake's growth. This tactic helped me accumulate a hoard of six or eight hundred shares for my next Wall Street venture.
"How did you use short selling to make money, and what were your typical gains?","I sometimes varied the process by selling some stock short, without overdoing it. I was satisfied with my six or eight hundred clear for each crack. One day the stunt worked so well that it went far beyond all calculations for a ten-point swing."
"What happened when you sold 200 shares at one broker's office, and how did the other brokers react?","That was too much of a good thing for them. They were sore as pups about it and they began to say things over the wires. So I went and saw the manager, the same man who had been so anxious to get my account, and he eventually agreed to pay me."
"How did you handle a situation where a broker was trying to deny your order due to a 'fictitious market', and what did you say to him?","I told him that if he accepted my order, he had to let me out as well for fairness. I also accused him of trying to prove that someone put up a job, and ultimately, he agreed to pay me."
"Why did you return to New York from the wire houses, and what motivated your decision?","I had saved up a fair-sized roll, and there wasn't so much money to be made in the five wire houses. I decided to return to New York because I wanted to make more money by trading on my own system."
What happened when you encountered another trader who was trying to scam customers?,"I got tired of his talk, so I told him: 'You'll pay it to me right now and here.' He eventually forked over the cash after some arguing. The other traders were more cautious and didn't want to risk being sued."
"When did you decide to return to New York with your friend, and what was the initial attraction that led you back?","I decided to return to New York because I had heard that there was money to be made in the five wire houses. So, I invited a friend of mine who also was a trader to motor to New York with me."
"How did you initially perceive the bucket shop, and what changed your mind about stopping?","I drove by the street where the bucket shop was located to see what it looked like. When I saw it, my friend and I couldn't resist the temptation to stop and have a look inside."
"What impression did the manager of the bucket shop make on you, and how did he treat you when you arrived?","The manager was very impressive. He looked like an actor or stump speaker. He greeted us with enthusiasm and made us feel welcome, even though we didn't look like typical Yale students."
"How did the market conditions at the bucket shop affect your trading decisions, and what was your strategy?","The market was philanthropically inclined that morning, with a clamoring desire to increase the supply of collegiate pocket money. I decided to trade conservatively at first but gradually increased my line as I won."
What was your experience like when you closed out your trades and collected your profits from the bucket shop?,"I cleaned up within a few dollars of fifteen hundred. When I dropped in on the great orator again, he hesitated but eventually accepted an order to sell five hundred shares of Sugar stock. The stock broke over a point, and I closed out, giving him the ticket and collecting my profits."
"What was your initial experience like trading in the stock market, and what motivated you to return to Wall Street?","I started trading conservatively but increased my line as I won. My friend followed me, and we cleaned up within a few dollars of fifteen hundred. This success motivated me to return to Wall Street for a third attempt."
"How did the famous orator's reaction to your trades affect his pride, and what lesson did you learn from this experience?","The orator was initially confident in his own abilities but became frustrated when he realized he had been outmaneuvered. His reaction hurt his pride, which taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of studying my system and avoiding mistakes."
"When did you first start working in the stock market, and what was your initial job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did you lose your initial fortune of $10,000, and what were some of the mistakes you made that led to this loss?",I lost my first ten thousand dollars when I was about twenty years old. I made the mistake of trading out of season all the time and gambling when I couldn't follow my system. It taught me a valuable lesson: there's nothing like losing everything to teach you what not to do.
"What drove you to return to Wall Street for your third attempt, and what were some of the lessons you learned from your previous experiences?","I returned to Wall Street after being fooled in my previous attempts. I had been studying to locate the trouble with my system that had led to my defeats. The experience taught me that when you know what not to do, you begin to learn what to do to win."
"At what point did I increase my stake, and what amount was it?",I increased my stake to fifty thousand dollars when I was about twenty-two years old.
"What were some of the reasons you thought you lost money after your return from St. Louis or during the May ninth panic, and what did you learn from those experiences?","I had theories, or remedies, for some of the faults I thought I found in my play, but I needed actual practice to truly learn. Losing all my money taught me what not to do, and after that, I began to learn what to do to win."
"What is your main concern with over-specialization, and how does it affect a person's success in speculation?","I think that over-specialization can be very detrimental. It leads to an expensive inelasticity because you're not adapting quickly enough to the changing market conditions. The game of speculation isn't just about mathematics or set rules; there's more to it than that. You need to understand the behavior of a stock, its actions, and whether it's going to follow the precedents you've observed. If you can't diagnose a stock correctly, you can't make an accurate prognosis, and certainly not a profit."
"Can you describe your early job in the stock market, and how it helped you develop your skills?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
How do you approach reading charts and using them to make investment decisions?,"My approach is based on observing the behavior of a stock, rather than just looking at mathematical formulas. I study its past performances and look for patterns that can help me predict future movements."
"What role do charts play in your investment strategy, and how do you avoid getting caught up in their limitations?","Charts are a valuable tool for those who can read them correctly. However, many people become obsessed with the technical aspects of chart analysis and lose sight of the bigger picture. I try to stay focused on the overall behavior of the market and avoid getting too caught up in the details."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did you develop your skills?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did your mathematical skills help you in your early career, and what kind of charts were used in stock trading back then?","My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately. In fact, I was so good with numbers that I completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school. The charts used were based on a very careful and minute study of the behavior of prices in many markets—stocks, bonds, grain, cotton, money, and so on."
"What was your initial experience working in the stock market, and how did you get started?",I went to work when I was just out of grammar school. I got a job as quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures. At school I did three years of arithmetic in one. I was particularly good at mental arithmetic.
"How did you transition from bucket shops to more serious trading, and what changes did you make to your approach?","I made the change by studying what was going to happen instead of just reacting to it. I had to start much earlier if I wanted to catch the move in Fullerton's office. I studied trade reports, railroad earnings, financial and commercial statistics. This taught me the essential difference between betting on fluctuations and anticipating inevitable advances and declines."
How did you learn to trade and what was your approach to studying the market?,"I had to study what was going to happen; to anticipate stock movements. That sounds asininely commonplace, but I studied reports, railroad earnings, financial and commercial statistics, and more. I learned to differentiate between betting on fluctuations and anticipating inevitable advances and declines."
What motivated you to continue learning and improving your trading methods?,"I was making money on balance, which encouraged me to learn as fast as possible. However, if I had lost more often, it might have spurred me to more continuous study."
What did you learn from your partial victories and defeats in trading?,"I learned that there was just as much to gain from partial victory as from defeat. For example, I had made a profit on a bull market by buying stocks early, but I also learned the importance of taking profits and waiting for reactions, rather than trying to play it too conservatively."
"How did you learn about different types of suckers, and what is the difference between them?","I discovered that suckers differ among themselves according to the degree of experience. The tyro knows nothing, but the second-grade sucker thinks he knows a great deal and makes others feel that way too. He's the experienced sucker who has studied not the market itself but a few remarks about it made by higher grades of suckers."
"What is your approach to investing in bull markets, and how do you take advantage of reactions?","I tried to play it conservatively, taking profits and buying back my stocks on reactions. However, I often waited for a reaction that never came, which ultimately cost me twenty thousand dollars instead of the twenty thousand I should have made."
How do you distinguish between an unadulterated plain sucker and a careful Mike sucker like yourself?,"I knew I was playing it intelligently according to the intelligence of others, but I also realized that suckers differ among themselves. The plain unadulterated sucker buys blindly because he hopes blindly, while the careful Mike sucker tries to change their bucket-shop methods and thinks they're solving their problem."
"How did you develop your skills and knowledge of the stock market, and what inspired you to change your approach?","I developed my skills through experience and a desire to improve. I was particularly good at mental arithmetic, which helped me in my work as a quotation-board boy. However, I realized that I needed to change my methods to stay ahead in the game."
What is the difference between a 'sucker' and a 'Careful Mike' in terms of their approach to investing?,"A sucker is someone who buys blindly on declines, hoping to make money, but ultimately getting taken advantage of. A Careful Mike, like myself, tries to change his methods and learn from others, but still makes mistakes."
"Can you tell us about the legend of Partridge in your office, and what made him stand out among his peers?","Partridge was an older man who never volunteered advice or bragged about his winnings. He was a great listener and always thanked those who gave him tips, even if they didn't work out. Despite not being the most active contributor to the firm, he had a reputation for being rich and wise."
"When you were younger, what was your first job, and how did it prepare you for a career in the stock market?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did you interpret Old Turkey's advice to 'buy in a bull market', and what did it mean to you?","To be honest, I didn't understand what he meant at first. He'd say it like it was some kind of magic formula or a talisman that would guarantee success. But later on, I learned that when he said 'bull market', he just meant the market was looking good and people were optimistic about buying stocks."
"How did you feel when someone like Elmer Harwood gave you investment advice without considering your own situation, and what did it reveal about him?","I felt a bit taken advantage of, to be honest. It was like he thought he owned me body and soul just because he had given me some tips. He didn't seem to care that I might not have the same goals or risk tolerance as he did. It showed me that amateur tipsters often think they're above the game, even when they don't know what's really going on."
Can you describe your first job and how it helped you develop your skills?,I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did Mr. Partridge's response to your tip make you feel, and what advice were you trying to give him?","I gave Mr. Partridge a tip to buy Climax Motors, and he was supposed to sell when the stock went down in value. However, he refused to sell, citing that he would lose his job if he did so. I was disappointed because I thought he should take my advice to minimize his losses."
"What do you think is the key difference between a tip giver and a tip taker, based on your experience with Mr. Partridge?","I've found that most tip givers tend to be tip takers themselves. They often get caught up in their own enthusiasm for a particular stock and forget about the potential risks. It's like they think they 'own' the person giving them the tip, even before they know how it will turn out."
"Can you explain what a bull market is, and why Mr. Partridge was reluctant to sell his stock during this time?","A bull market is when the stock prices are rising, and I told Mr. Partridge that it's a good time to take profits and buy back in on the reaction. However, he saw it as a bull market and thought that selling would put him out of his job. It was a classic case of being blinded by enthusiasm."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did you get it?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
How did old Mr. Partridge's advice to Elmer Harwood help you with your trading education?,"I realized that when old Mr. Partridge kept telling customers, 'This is a bull market!' he meant to tell them that the big money was in sizing up the entire market and its trend, not just reading individual fluctuations."
What was the key to making big money for you in trading?,"It was my sitting tight! It's no trick at all to be right on the market; it's about being patient and waiting for the trend to develop, rather than trying to time every individual fluctuation."
"What was one of the key lessons you learned from your experience in Wall Street, and how did it help you make big money?",I realized that my thinking wasn't what made me successful; it was my ability to sit tight. I learned to focus on the overall market trend rather than trying to time individual stock movements. This allowed me to avoid making impulsive decisions and instead wait for the right moment to act.
"What advice would you give to someone who wants to be a successful trader, but struggles with patience and impulsiveness?","My advice is to learn to give up trying to catch the last eighth or the first. These two periods are often the most expensive in terms of losses. Instead, focus on studying general market conditions and waiting for the turn of the market. It's not about being right all the time, but about having the patience to wait for the right moment to act."
"How did you develop your approach to trading, and what have you learned about studying general conditions?","I've learned to study general conditions, take a position, and stick to it. I can wait without impatience and see setbacks as temporary. It's the big swing that makes the big money for you."
"What role did tape reading play in your trading strategy, and how did you manage your losses?","Most of my winnings were made through tape reading, which suited the markets we had. I wasn't losing as often or irritatingly as before, even though I'd been broke three times in less than two years."
What approach did you use to capitalize your increasing assets after making mistakes?,"I added a new 'Don't!' to my schedule of assets every time I made a mistake. The nicest way to increase my wealth was by not cutting down on my living expenses, and I made sure to live up to my means."
"How did you capitalize your increasing assets, and what expenses did you prioritize?","I had my own automobile, so I couldn't see any sense in skimping on living when I was taking it out of the market. The nicest way to capitalize my assets was by not cutting down on my living expenses."
"What skills did you find particularly useful in your early career, and how did they benefit you?","My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately. In fact, I was so good with numbers that I completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school."
What was the experience like when you were short thirty-five hundred Sugar in the Cosmopolitan and had a hunch something was wrong?,"I've had those moments where I felt like closing a trade, but sometimes I'd ignore that feeling. It's funny, looking back - it's almost as if my instincts have been right more often than not."
"When did you first return to your old broker, Harding Brothers, and what was the state of your account at that time?","I went back to my first brokers, Harding Brothers, after a little vacation. My account had gotten pretty active - I could swing three or four thousand shares."
"What happens when you have a hunch to reverse your position in the market, and how often do you follow it?","I yield to my hunch most of the time. However, at times I pooh-poohed the idea and told myself it was just asinine to follow any sudden blind impulses."
"Describe a situation where you had a hunch to sell, but didn't follow it, and how did that turn out for you?","I recall a vacation in Atlantic City in 1906. I had a friend with me who was also a customer of Harding Brothers. I had no interest in the market at the time, but my hunch told me to sell. Unfortunately, the next day the market dropped badly."
"When did you start visiting the Boardwalk with your friend, and why were you doing it?","We started going up to the Boardwalk every morning after breakfast. It was a habit for me, but also something I enjoyed doing to kill time and breathe in the salt air."
"Why did you decide to sell Union Pacific stock, even though your friend thought it was a wise decision to hold onto it?","I had a feeling that I ought to sell Union Pacific. I couldn't find any reason why I wanted to do so, but I just felt like selling it. My friend tried to get me to see things from his perspective, but my gut told me otherwise."
"When did you decide to sell a thousand shares of Union Pacific, despite your friend's bullish stance on the stock?","I decided to sell that stock after my hunch said otherwise. I had always made money following my instincts, and in this case, I just felt something was going to happen."
"Why did you refuse to explain your reasoning for selling the stock, despite your friend's request for a justification?","I told him I couldn't give any reason or tell fortunes. My instincts were leading me to sell, and I trusted them. I wasn't going to second-guess myself."
"What drove you to sell a large amount of stock without any clear reason, and what was your thought process behind this decision?",I don't know why I want to sell it. I only know I do want to. The urge was so strong that I sold another thousand.
"What did you tell your friend when he asked you for reasons to sell the stock, and how did he react?",I told him I couldn't give him any reason or tell fortunes. He thought me 'stark crazy' and tried to get out of there with me.
"How did you determine when to sell more stock, and what was your strategy in this regard?","I doubled up on my sales after the market began to slide off. I knew that nothing could stop a substantial break, so I pushed my luck for all it was worth."
"What was your reaction when another trader suggested selling the stock short, and how did you respond?","I told him he'd make a killing if he sold it short. 'Yes,' I said, 'and if that chap had sold it short, look at what he would have made! Sell some UP. yourself.'"
"How did you approach selling short, and what motivated your decision to take a certain amount of risk?","I wasn't thinking of anything except that I was right 100% right and that this was a heaven-sent opportunity. It was up to me to take advantage of it. I sold more because I thought with such a big line of shorts out, it wouldn't take much of a rally to wipe out my paper profits and possibly my principal. But I wasn't recklessly betting; I was really playing conservatively."
"What drove your success in selling short during the market crash, and how did you avoid being seen as reckless or impulsive?","I have no explanation to give you, either scientific or childish. I am telling you what I did, and why, and what came of it. I was much less concerned with the mystery of the hunch than with the fact that I got a quarter of a million out of it. It meant that I could now swing a much bigger line than ever, if or when the time came for it."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did you develop your skills?","I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately."
How did you determine that Union Pacific's stock was being accumulated by someone with a large bank roll and knowledge of what was happening in the market?,"I noticed that the price was high, but the stock acted as if it were being accumulated. I watched it for a couple of days without trading in it, and the more I watched it, the more convinced I became that it was being bought on balance by someone who wasn't just speculating, but had a big bank roll and knew what was going on. It seemed very clever accumulation."
"When did you first notice that Union Pacific was being accumulated, and what made you think it was a clever move?","I noticed it a couple of days before I decided to buy it. What convinced me was that the stock was acting as if it were being bought on balance by someone who knew what they were doing. It seemed like someone with a big bankroll and knowledge of the market was accumulating shares, which made me think it was a clever move."
What did Mr. Ed Harding say to you when he found out you had bought all that Union Pacific stock?,"He told me I was crazy for buying so much of the stock and that I was an easy mark for the insiders who were feeding it to me. He warned me that I should get out while I still had a chance, as it was a crime to be long on that stock at its current level."
"Why did you decide to follow Ed Harding's advice to sell out of Union Pacific, despite my years of studying the behavior of stocks and my perception of certain symptoms that usually accompanied a substantial rise?",I suppose I must have concluded that my tape reading told me the stock was being absorbed simply because very clever manipulation by insiders made the tape tell a story that wasn't true.
"What did you do after selling out of your long position in Union Pacific, and how much money did you put out to sell four thousand shares short?","I sold out all my long stock, and then I sold four thousand shares short, putting most of it out around $162."
"When did you realize that selling out all your Union Pacific stock was a mistake, and what led you to that realization?","I realized it the moment I heard the news of the directors' declaration of a 10 per cent dividend on the stock. My own convictions had set aside for the suspicions of a friend, simply because he was disinterested and as a rule knew what he was doing."
"What was your initial reaction when you saw Union Pacific making new high records, and how did that affect your decision to buy in?","I said to myself, 'This is no stock for me to be short of.' I had read the tape accurately and had been a ninny to let Ed Harding shake my own resolution. There was no sense in recriminations, because I had no time to lose."
"How much did you initially lose when you gave an order to buy in your shorts, and how much more did you end up making after getting out?","I had a three-point loss on it at $165. However, my brokers paid $172 and $174 for some of the shares before they were through, and I ended up making about fifteen thousand dollars besides recovering the forty thousand dollars I had lost."
"When did you realize that Ed Harding's attempt to save you money actually helped you, and what was the outcome?","I found out when I got my reports that Ed Harding's kindly intentioned interference cost me forty thousand dollars. However, I not only made up the forty thousand dollars I had lost but about fifteen thousand besides."
What was the lesson you learned from this experience that helped you improve your trading skills?,"It was the lesson of that episode that, firmly believe, completed my education as a trader. It taught me to gain confidence in myself and shake off the old method of trading."
"How did this experience change your approach to trading, and what was the result?","From then on, I began to think of basic conditions instead of individual stocks. It was a long and difficult step to take, but it marked a significant improvement in my trading skills."
"What was your financial situation like after a particularly difficult day in the stock market, and how did you manage to turn it around?","I had lost forty thousand dollars, but then I made back that amount plus fifteen thousand. It was a remarkable turnaround."
Who was Ed Harding and what role did he play in your financial situation?,"Ed Harding tried to take advantage of me. If he hadn't done so, my day would have ended much worse than it did."
"When you made a significant profit from your trading, what was the outcome?",I not only made up the forty thousand dollars I had lost but about fifteen thousand besides.
How do you advise individuals when it comes to market predictions and stock recommendations?,"I never hesitate to tell a man that I am bullish or bearish. But I do not tell people to buy or sell any particular stock. In a bull market, all stocks go up, and in a bear market, they go down."
"How do you approach buying and selling stocks, and what's your strategy when it comes to timing?","I believe that the most comfortable way of buying stocks is to buy on a rising market. My goal isn't just to buy at a low price or go short at top prices, but to buy or sell at the right time. When I'm bearish, I sell at lower levels than my previous sales, and when I'm bullish, I buy on a rising scale. I also like to build up positions gradually, buying more shares as the market rises, until I feel it's time to stop."
"How do you determine if an order is correct, and what factors influence your decision?","I shoot an order to buy four thousand shares when the price is 113 -¾. To verify its correctness, I test it by selling one thousand shares at a lower price. If I receive two thousand shares at $114 and five hundred shares at 114 -½, with the rest coming in later, I know I'm right. It's how I get the four thousand shares that tells me whether I'm right in buying that particular stock at that particular time."
"What are your thoughts on buying stocks too cheap or easily, and can you share an experience with Deacon S. V. White?","I never want to buy stocks too cheap or too easily. I remember a story about Deacon S. V. White, who was one of the big operators on the Street. He was clever and brave. One day, a man rushed into his office with information that H. O. Havemeyer was buying Sugar. The deacon looked at him calmly and said he'd pay for the information, but also warned him to be sure. It shows how cautious Deacon White was when it came to insider deals."
"How did you get your information about H. O. Havemeyer's plans to buy Sugar, and what was the reaction of the deacon when he heard it?","I overheard some inside information from a source who told me that H. O. Havemeyer was buying all he could get his hands on, and that there was going to be a killing in the common stock. The deacon was interested in this information, but initially seemed skeptical, asking if I was sure about it."
"What did you say to the deacon when he asked you if he should use your information, and what was his response?","I assured him that my information was absolutely straight and worth a lot. He agreed to use it right away, but also asked me when he would be using it, which made me a bit suspicious."
What did the deacon ask Frank to do after hearing your information about H. O. Havemeyer's plans?,"The deacon instructed Frank to sell ten thousand shares of Sugar right away. When I expressed surprise at this, he seemed calm and told me to go ahead with it."
I came into this business with some of the best information I ever had. Can you explain why the deacon acted on my tip despite seeming to contradict it?,"You were bringing in hot news, but you didn't give me any details about who was buying. The deacon knew that if Mr. Havemeyer and his gang were indeed buying the stock, they would be a large group of buyers, which would likely drive up the price. So when he saw the execution on the tape, confirming that the order had been sold at a lower price than you initially stated, he took it as an opportunity to buy more, not sell."
Why did the deacon seem surprised by your claim of knowing H. O. Havemeyer was buying the stock?,I had already told him that Mr. Havemeyer and his gang were buying it earlier in our conversation. The deacon must have been testing me to see if I was truly telling the truth or just trying to spin a yarn. He wanted to make sure I wasn't just making up stories to impress him.
How did you determine that the tipster's information about H.O. Havemeyer buying Sugar stock was trustworthy?,"I'm acting on my own experience and judgment, not just relying on what you told me. I've been in Wall Street a long time, and I appreciate anyone who feels sorry for me. However, I still had to verify the information through my own actions."
What was your thought process when you decided to buy 30 thousand shares of Sugar stock after seeing the report from Frank?,"I didn't just take your word for it. I wanted to see if there was any truth to what you said H.O. Havemeyer and his friends were buying the stock in that way. So, I decided to buy 30 thousand shares myself to test the waters."
"Can you describe your first experience with buying stocks, and how did you determine its feasibility?","I started with the first ten thousand shares, which went fairly easily. It wasn't conclusive, but the second ten thousand was absorbed by a market that didn't stop rising. This showed me that someone was willing to take all the stock offered."
"What's your approach to buying and selling stocks, and how do you determine when to start or stop?","I always try to buy effectively to help my side of the market. When it comes to selling, nobody can sell unless somebody wants those stocks. I swing a pretty fair line, accumulating a big profit on paper. However, I have to wait until I have a market to take it, and then I must seize the opportunity when conditions are right."
"How do you approach making investment decisions, and what is your advice to someone looking to invest?","I believe that it's essential to sell when you can, not when you want to. To learn when to sell, you need to watch and test the market. It's also crucial to wait for the right conditions before starting a new investment. Much depends on beginning at exactly the right time."
"What was the turning point that made you realize the importance of timing in the stock market, and what were the costs associated with this realization?","I realized the importance of starting at exactly the right time. It took me years to understand this, and it cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars."
How did the Union Pacific incident in Saratoga in 1906 change your approach to making investment decisions?,"That event made me more independent than ever from tips and talk from other people. Events, not vanity, proved that I could read the tape more accurately than most of the people around me. I was also better equipped than the average customer because I had no speculative prejudices."
"How do you approach investing, and what is your one steadfast prejudice when it comes to making investment decisions?","My approach is based on facts, not someone else's interpretation. I get my own meanings out of facts, and they are the only way in which the meaning reaches me. If I believe something, it's because I simply must."
"How did your ability to read the tape accurately help you in your trading, and what was the driving force behind your approach?","I've found that my ability to read the tape more accurately than most people around me was a real asset. Events, not vanity, proved for me that I could do this. My one steadfast prejudice is against being wrong, and I always try to get my own meanings out of facts as I observe them."
"How did you approach market analysis, and what was the key factor in determining whether a trade would be successful?","I never argue with the tape. To be angry at the market because it goes against you is like getting mad at your lungs because you have pneumonia. Instead, I focus on understanding the basic conditions that drive the swing of the market. The big money must necessarily be in the big swing, and whatever gives a big swing its initial impulse will eventually continue as long as the impelling forces determine."
"How did you learn to trade, and what were some of the challenges you faced?","It took me a long time to learn to trade on probabilities. I had to grasp the general principle of being bullish in a bull market and bearish in a bear market, but it wasn't easy. I didn't have enough capital to speculate until later, and even then, my brokers initially saw me as just a lucky boy plunger. It took time for me to build confidence and become a more valuable customer."
"What changed your approach to trading, and how did you start studying the game from a different angle?","When I stopped focusing solely on daily fluctuations in specific stocks, I had to study the game from a different perspective. I started working back from quotations to first principles, analyzing price fluctuations to basic conditions. This new approach allowed me to make more informed decisions and ultimately become a better trader."
What sparked a change in your approach to the stock market and led you to reevaluate your strategy?,"The moment I ceased to be satisfied with merely studying the tape, I had to study the game from a different angle. I worked back from the quotation to first principles; from price fluctuations to basic conditions."
"What was your initial assessment of the market situation in 1906, and what led you to conclude that selling stocks was the best option?","I studied the situation in 1906 and I thought that the money outlook was particularly serious. Much actual wealth the world over had been destroyed. Everybody must sooner or later feel the pinch, and therefore nobody would be in position to help anybody."
When did you decide to sell stocks and what motivated your decision?,"I decided to sell after realizing that the market was heading for a smash, as I had observed in other disasters like the carload of race horses worth eight thousand dollars. The railroads were suffering greatly, and I figured that selling stocks would be my best option."
"What was your initial approach to selling stocks, and how did you adjust it as the market fluctuated?","Initially, I sold stocks after making up my mind which way I was going to trade. However, when the market went off and came back, I realized that I had sold too soon and covered when the rally began. I then waited for the next downturn, but unfortunately, another big rally occurred, forcing me to cover again."
"What was your mistake in selling stocks during a bear market, and what did you learn from it?","My mistake was selling stocks too soon during a bear market. I had sold them short, which was proper, but I had sold them too early. I learned that my position was right, but my play was wrong, and I needed to wait for the inevitable smash."
"How did you adapt your strategy as the market continued to fluctuate, and what challenges did you face?","I adapted by waiting for the next downturn and then buying back in. However, every day brought the market closer to another rally, forcing me to cover again. I faced the challenge of not being able to coordinate my observations, which hindered my success."
When did you start trading and how old were you at the time?,"I started trading when I was nearly twenty-seven years old, having been in the game for twelve years before that."
"What happened during your first trade due to a crisis, and what did you learn from it?","During my first trade due to a crisis, I started selling short too soon. However, just as I was about to make money, the market rallied again, and I ended up losing everything - it was 'right and busted'!"
"How did you initially react when you spotted what you believed to be a large pile of dollars, and what mistake did you make?","I sprinted toward it because I was too eager to prove to myself that I had seen real money. In hindsight, I should have walked instead of running, as my enthusiasm clouded my judgment about the timing."
"What was the significance of having confidence from your trading firm, Harding's office, and how did it affect your subsequent actions?","I had traded with them for many years, and they had faith in me. They knew I would eventually come out on top, so there was no issue with continuing to trade with them as long as my credit remained high."
"How did you feel about the announcement of the new issue of Great Northern stock, and why do you think it was ominous?","This consideration struck me as more than ominous. The announcement of a new issue of stock by the Northern Pacific and Great Northern roads, with payments to be made on an installment plan, seemed like a warning sign. I had always seen these rights as valuable, but now that even powerful banking houses were questioning whether the stockholders could pay cash for the bargain, it was a cause for concern."
"Why did you feel pressured to sell your position in Great Northern preferred immediately, and what did Ed Harding think about it?","I felt pressure to sell because I had been trading successfully with Harding's office in the past, and they had made a great deal of money out of my trading. They were confident that I would be right again soon, but I saw an opportunity to profit from their caution by selling now. Ed Harding thought it was better to wait before putting out a big short line because of the market's tendency for big rallies."
"When did you start selling the Great Northern preferred stock, and what led to your decision to do so?","I decided to sell right away when I saw the ad from the bankers confessing their fear that the railroads wouldn't be able to pay cash for the bargain. The price was $330, which is valuable since it's above par. However, I noticed a few days later that St. Paul had announced an issue of its own, with the payment date set ahead of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific payments. This made me realize that the railroads were desperate for money, and I knew I should sell 'em!"
"What was your approach to selling stocks during this campaign, and how did it differ from previous mistakes?","I sold more intelligently this time around. I profited by my earlier and costly mistakes. I told Harding that I thought we should sell the Great Northern preferred at $330, and he agreed. My approach was different because I had made up my mind for keeps after realizing that the railroads were struggling financially. I was no longer hesitant or unsure, which allowed me to make better decisions."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and what skills did you bring to it?",I started working right after grammar school as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures and particularly good at mental arithmetic.
"How did your analytical approach to the market differ from others, and what drove your confidence in selling stocks?","I wasn't guessing; I was anticipating the inevitable based on my analysis of conditions affecting the stock market. I simply couldn't see anything but lower prices, so I had to act on it."
How did you respond to warnings from others that the rally had reached its end and that selling stocks would be a mistake?,"I wouldn't even argue with these warning voices; they knew I wasn't grateful for their concerns, and I was confident in my own analysis."
What advice or words of wisdom did your friend offer after you made a quarter of a million by selling Union Pacific stocks?,"My friend attributed my success to Providence working in its mysterious way to make me sell stocks, and he understood my ability to predict stock movements with one stock."
"When did you make a quarter of a million by selling Union Pacific stocks, and what did your friend think about it?",I made that money when I sold Union Pacific stocks based on my instincts. My friend thought it was Providence working in its mysterious way to make me sell stocks at the right time.
"What did you tell your friend when he asked if you were covered, and why?","I told him I wasn't covered because there's no reason to be. He said 'for the best reason in the world,' which was to make money. According to him, people who touch bottom eventually start going up."
"What did an old-timer say after hearing you explain your market views, and what was William R. Travers' response when talking about market stiffness?",An old-timer reminded me of a story where William R. Travers met someone who thought the market was too stiff to be bearish. Travers responded with 'yes! The s-s-stiffness of death!' and later asked to see the books of a company he had an interest in.
"What happened when you tried to sell other stocks after your success with Union Pacific, and which stock stood out as a strong performer?","I was pushing my luck by trying to sell other stocks. The only impressive exception was Reading, which seemed like the Rock of Gibraltar. Everybody thought it was cornered, but I let it have some space."
What made you prefer to sell short instead of buying long on the stock market?,I naturally preferred to seek and hit the soft spots instead of attacking the more strongly protected specialties. My tape reading found easier money for me in other stocks.
"When did you first start trading, and what was your approach to it?","I started trading right after grammar school. I went in with a solo approach, playing the lone hand, and sticking to my principles without compromise."
"How did you anticipate a general break in the market, and what conditions helped you make your decisions?","I anticipated a general break by looking at underlying conditions. I trusted that my true allies – the strongest and truest in the world – were helping me with all their might. The inexorable logic of events was making money for me, provided I did not get too impatient."
"What motivated you to short sell Reading stock when it refused to decline, despite your conviction that it should?","I felt insulted by Reading holding firm, as though everything were serene. But I knew the pool was carrying a lot of stock that it would not be able to carry when the money stringency grew more pronounced. My theory was that if Reading didn't decline, then my theory – and logic – were wrong."
"How did your experience in the bucket shops shape your approach to trading, and what mistakes did you learn from?","I learned from my early mistakes in the bucket shops. I started out trading in and out of season every day, whether or not conditions were right. But after making that mistake twice, I made sure to be more disciplined with my trades."
"When did you start selling stocks in the bucket shops, and what was your experience like?","I started selling stocks in the bucket shops within a few minutes of starting my career. I took in my entire short line at $92 and had a wonderful time after that, making a good bit of money."
"What was your approach to trading when you made a big profit, and why did you cash out?","When I made a big profit, I wanted to cash in so that I could feel I had been right. The rallies had broken me before, and I didn't want to let the next rally wipe me out. Instead of sitting tight, I went to Florida for a rest and to enjoy my winnings."
"When did you first trade in the bucket shops, and what were some of your early mistakes?","I made my first big mistake by trading in and out of season every day, regardless of whether conditions were right. I lost the first ten thousand dollars I made because of this mistake."
What triggered your decision to get off the boat and return to Wall Street after seeing a newspaper about the big market rally?,"I saw that the market had rallied ten points or more, which was too much for me. I realized that moderate rallies from time to time were reasonable, but the bear market wasn't over yet."
When did you arrive in Palm Beach and what brought you there?,"I arrived in Palm Beach after a fishing trip, where I needed some relaxation due to being under a severe strain. However, as soon as I saw the significant rally in prices, I no longer felt the need for a vacation and knew I had to sell stocks."
What was your initial reaction when you saw the quotation board and what triggered your decision to take action?,"I glanced at the newspaper brought by my friend and saw that the market had experienced a big rally. This made me realize that the bear market was not over, and I couldn't ignore it any longer. The sight of the quotation board was my pressing need, and I knew I had to take a look."
How did you use your knowledge of historical market trends to inform your investment decision in Anaconda?,"I had an old trading theory that when a stock crosses a significant price point, like $300, it tends to continue going higher. I figured that when Anaconda crossed $300, it would keep going and probably touch $340 in a jiffy."
What motivated you to buy Anaconda despite being bearish on the overall market?,"I was bearish on the entire market, but I also believed in Anaconda's potential for quick movement. I wanted to confirm my observations and take advantage of its strong buying momentum."
"Why did you decide to buy a large quantity of Anaconda shares, despite the uncertainty of the market at that time?","I figured that if I bought thirty-two thousand shares of Anaconda, it would be a nice little flyer and give me a profit. The money from that sale would help swell my margin for later bear operations."
"What was your strategy when you saw the quotation for Anaconda stock on the first day, and what did you suspect about John, the broker with you?","I wanted quick action, but I suspected that John had some of his own shares and might not execute my orders correctly. When we got the quotation, he was in a panic because he didn't know if the stock had gone up or down. I reassured him it would be all right the next day."
"What were your thoughts when you saw Anaconda's price fall back to $301 on the second day, and what did you do next?","I realized that if Anaconda fell back to $301, it meant a fake movement. I made up my mind to sell all my shares immediately, eight thousand full shares. When I told the operator to sell them, he was hesitant, but I insisted, 'Sell it! Don't argue about it!'"
"What did you think was the correct course of action when you were wrong, as evidenced by Anaconda's price movement?","When a man is wrong, the only thing to do is to be right by ceasing to be wrong. In this case, I had bought shares expecting a thirty or forty point rise, and it didn't happen. So, I decided to cut my losses and sell all my shares."
"What was your plan when you fell back to $301, and how did you contact the New York office to execute it?","I wanted to sell all my Anaconda shares at that price. So, I discreetly told the telegraph operator in the New York office to sell 8,000 full shares of Anaconda stock."
"How did Oliver and Ollie Black know about your plan to sell Anaconda stock, and what was their reaction to it?","I'm not sure how they knew, but Ollie claimed he got the information from Charlie Kratzer, the telegraph operator. When I told them I was selling all my shares at $301, they were surprised and even a bit amused by my decision. They warned me that I'd be sorry because the price would likely rise to $500."
"When did you start selling stocks, and what triggered your decision to do so?","I started selling stocks the moment I got the report of the sale of the last of my long stock. The market had just completed its outrageous rally, and it was safe to sell them."
What was Oliver Black's mistake in anticipating a further rally in Anaconda stock?,"Oliver Black waited for a further rally, which showed that he didn't know the course of the market. The rally had run its course, and it was safe to sell stocks."
What happened if you had limited your selling price to $300?,"If I had limited my selling price to $300, I would never have gotten rid of the stock. No, sir! When you want to get out, you need to be willing to sell at any price."
"When did you decide to sell your long stock, and what triggered that decision?","I sold my long stock when I received the report of its sale. The confirmation from Palm Beach told me there was no market for it, which made me realize I had made a profit and should sell."
"How did you feel about being in a bear market, and how did it affect your trading decisions?","I felt like I needed to be in New York because Palm Beach was too far away. Being in a bear market meant everything was going down, so I had to stay on the bear side of the market for four months, covering rallies and selling out when necessary."
"What did you learn from your experience with the San Francisco earthquake break, and how did it influence your trading approach?","I learned that even if I'm right about being bullish or bearish, making a profit requires me to be at the right time. After losing my entire gain in the San Francisco earthquake break, I was playing safe by covering rallies and selling out when necessary."
"When did you decide to head back to the United States and resume trading, and what was your financial situation at that time?",I sailed for Europe when I had more than three-quarters of a million dollars to my name. It looked like a good balance to me.
"How did you feel when you heard about the extra dividend declared by Smelters, and what did it mean for your plans?","The news of the extra dividend changed everything for me. I realized that the bull cliques were still fighting against common sense, trying to put up the market before it crashed."
"Why do you think some speculators are prone to being wishful thinkers, and how does this affect their approach to trading?",I believe that big men on the Street can be just as prone to wishful thinking as politicians or plain suckers. This attitude is fatal for a speculator like myself who has to rely on both theory and practice.
When did you realize the bull market was doomed and what was your plan to profit from it?,"I knew that all bull manipulation was foredoomed to failure in that bear market. The instant I read the dispatch, I knew there was only one thing to do to be comfortable: sell Smelters short."
"Why did you decide to return to Paris and then quickly travel back to New York, and what made your decision to stay in New York logical?","My plans had been to return to Paris at the end of the month and sail for New York three weeks later. However, after receiving cabled reports from my brokers showing a significant drop in stock prices, I went back to Paris and then took a fast boat to New York. My decision was logical because it allowed me to be short of the market with over half a million dollars available for margins."
How did your understanding of general conditions and probabilities help you in your trading?,"I learned that studying general conditions, sizing them up so as to anticipate probabilities, was crucial. This helped me realize that I had finally found the right approach to trading: beginning at the right time, sticking to my position, and using tape reading."
"When did you start working for your money, and what changed in your approach to trading?",I went straight into work when I was just out of grammar school. I got a job as quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures. At school I did three years of arithmetic in one. I was particularly good at mental arithmetic. As quotation-board boy I posted the numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"What was your approach to trading before you became successful, and what led to your success?","My return was not due to my being bearish but to my being logical. I sold more stocks. As money got tighter call-money rates went higher and prices of stocks lower. I had foreseen it. At first, my foresight broke me. But now I was right and prospering."
What did you learn about the importance of studying general conditions in trading?,"I had learned that I had 123 I was no longer betting blindly or concerned with mastering the techniques of the game, but with earning my successes by hard study and clear thinking. I also had found out that nobody was immune from the danger of making sucker plays."
"What was my experience with money loans in the stock market, and how did brokers handle them?","I used to go to the Money Post to make money loans, but later I found out that most brokers were getting so big they didn't even bother going there when they had money to loan. Instead, they'd whisper 'Want a hundred?' to their friends on the floor, meaning they wanted to borrow $100,000 from them."
How did the behavior of certain commission houses affect the market for money loans?,"Those well-known commission houses would snap up any offerings of money, and since they were solvent, lenders could offer them money without worrying about getting it back. However, once they borrowed money on call, they'd just say they couldn't pay it back, leaving the lender with no choice but to renew the loan."
"What was the practice among Stock Exchange houses when it came to lending money to their fellows, and how did this impact lenders?","We used to send our men about the floor instead of to the Post. They would whisper 'Want a hundred?' meaning 'Do you wish to borrow a hundred thousand dollars?'. This allowed the borrower to set their own rate of interest, which fluctuated between 100 and 150 per cent per annum."
"What was the situation like on October 24, 1907, for borrowers and lenders in the Money Post?","Reports indicated that borrowers would have to pay whatever the lenders saw fit. The money crowd was much larger than usual, with hundreds of brokers hoping to borrow money from their firms. Without money, they had to sell stocks at any price they could get in a market where buyers were scarce and there was no money available."
"When did you realize that a severe panic was about to hit the market, and what made you think it?","I had seen a smash coming, but not the worst panic in our history. What made me think it was when my friend, the broker, told me he'd never seen anything like the haggard faces around the Money Post. He said that everybody was busted right now and there was absolutely no money in the market."
"How did Mr. Morgan respond to the president of the Stock Exchange's request for help, and what did he suggest as a solution?",Mr. Morgan told them that they would have to go back to the Exchange and tell everyone that there would be money available at the banks.
"How did you learn that J.P. Morgan had sufficient funds to support the stock market, and who informed you?","I learned from President Thomas that Mr. Morgan was willing to lend money, so I rushed back to the Exchange to announce it to my fellow members. Then, J.P. Morgan himself sent John T. Atterbury into the money crowd with a message of relief."
"How did John T. Atterbury calm down the fearful crowd in the Money Post, and what was his message?","Atterbury calmed the crowd by raising his hand like an exhorter at a revival meeting. He then announced that he was authorized to lend ten million dollars, telling the borrowers to 'take it easy' and promising that there would be enough money for everybody."
What did J.P. Morgan tell the bankers of New York when they protested that they were loaned up to the hilt and couldn't provide more funds?,"J.P. Morgan told them to use their reserves, which they did to the extent of about 128 million dollars."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and what skills did you bring to it?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did your mathematical skills help you in your early career, and what specific challenges did you face?","My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately. In fact, I completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school."
"What was your goal when you started trading, and what drove you to pursue it?",I had been king for a day! I wanted to determine the exact reason why I couldn't beat the game that I had beaten as a kid of fifteen in a bucket shop in Boston. It was a wild dream of mine that the same old stock market would one day eat out of my hand.
"How did you feel about your success on October 24, 1907, and what did it mean to you?","That morning was the day when my winnings exceeded one million dollars. It marked the successful ending of my first deliberately planned trading campaign. What I had foreseen had come to pass, but more than all these things was this: a wild dream of mine had been realised."
"What was the day that I felt would come when the stock market would crash, and what triggered my concern?","October 24, 1907. My friend told me how heavily I had been trading on the bear side, which caught the attention of a banker from one of the foremost banking houses in the Street."
What was your thought process when you realized that the market was not going to recover and that continuing to be short would be illogical?,"Since it was unwise and unpleasant to continue actively bearish, it was illogical for me to stay short. So I turned around and began to buy."
"What was your initial reaction to seeing the panic in the market, and how did it affect your decision-making?","I knew that a further break would only retard the recovery I was beginning to figure on. Such a panic would do much harm to the country generally. I made up my mind that since it was unwise and unpleasant to continue actively bearish, it was illogical for me to stay short."
"How did you persuade your friend Livingston to refrain from selling more stocks, and what motivated him to do so?","I appealed to his patriotism, saying that this was a case where he had to work for the benefit of all. He knew I was sore on some of the big guns for their role in trying to land the public with stock when they knew what was coming. He understood that by not selling more stocks, we could help the needed recovery in prices."
"What was your strategy after deciding to buy more stocks, and how did it affect your profits?","I told my friend to go back and tell Mr. Blank that I agreed with them, and that I fully realized the gravity of the situation. I went in and bought as much as I could carry - 100,000 shares that day for the long account. From then on, I did not sell another stock short for nine months."
"When did you finally achieve your dream of making big money, and what was it that allowed you to do so?","I had been out of the gambler class for nine months, which made me feel like I had truly achieved my dream. What allowed me to make big money was following a clear-cut plan and looking ahead."
What did you learn from your experience that made you 'permanently out of the gambler class'?,"I learned what it takes to trade intelligently in a big way. I had finally mastered the skills needed to make big money, and as a result, I was permanently removed from the gambler class."
"When did I start working in the stock market, and what was my first job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How do you think recognizing our own mistakes can help us improve, and what's the key to avoiding punishment?","The recognition of our own mistakes should not benefit us. However, there is a natural tendency to avoid punishment. To learn from our mistakes, we must analyze them objectively after the pain of punishment has passed. Sometimes, this introspection leads us to understand why we made a particular mistake and how it happened in our trade, but we won't know 'why.' After that, we let it go."
"What was your first million-dollar mistake, and when did you make it?","I made my first million-dollar mistake right after the big break of October 1907. At that time, having a million merely meant more reserves for me."
How does losing money affect you compared to making mistakes and taking losses?,"Losing money is the least of my troubles. I forget it overnight, but being wrong—the act of taking a loss—what damages my pocketbook and soul."
What happens to a person's perspective when they adapt to wealth or prosperity?,"A man adapts himself to conditions so quickly that he loses the perspective. He only remembers that there were things he could not do that he can do now, and it takes him a long time to forget that he used to be poor."
What made you prefer trading in commodities over stocks?,"I would rather play commodities than stocks. There is no question about their greater legitimacy, as it were. Commodity markets partake more of the nature of a commercial venture than trading in stocks does."
What is your approach to trading in commodities compared to stocks?,"The business of the trader in commodities is simply to get facts about the demand and supply, present and prospective. He does not indulge in guesses about a dozen things as he does in stocks."
"What is tape reading, and how does it differ from guessing or speculating?",Tape reading is not about having your fortune told; it's about ascertaining first how and next when to trade. You watch the market to determine the direction of prices—whether they're moving up or down—and understand that prices move along the line of least resistance.
"How do you differentiate between a bull and a bear market, and what's the key to making informed trading decisions?","A man with an open mind and reasonably clear sight can see whether it's a bull or bear market. It's never wise for a speculator to fit his facts to his theories. Instead, he should know whether to buy or sell based on the trend, which is evident from the start of the movement."
"How do you determine when to buy or sell, and what is your approach to understanding market trends?","I wait until the tape tells me that the time is ripe. I'm not led into trading by tokens; instead, I look for a clear signal from the market. The speculative line of least resistance at the moment of trading is key to determining when to get busy."
"What happens when a new trend begins, and how do you identify the point of greatest resistance?","Eventually, something happens that increases the power of either the upward or downward force. The buying at $130 will for the first time be stronger than the selling, or the selling at $120 will be stronger than the buying. This is when the price breaks through the old barrier and moves on."
"What role do accidents play in your market position, according to your experience?","Accidents—that is, the unexpected or unforeseen have always helped me in my market position whenever the latter has been based upon my determination of the line of least resistance."
"What factors do you consider when establishing your line of least resistance, and how do you incorporate them into your trading strategy?",I consider fundamental trade conditions and the force of the trading of that part of the community that happened to guess wrong and must now rectify mistakes. I also rely on accidents and unexpected events.
"What was your initial job in the stock market, and how did you utilize your mathematical skills?","I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room. My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately."
"What is the 'line of least resistance,' and how do you determine it?","The line of least resistance refers to the prevailing trend in the market. I establish my resistance points by watching the tape, and then I trade along that line as soon as I've determined it. However, human nature plays a significant role, and one must guard against many things – including oneself – to make informed decisions."
Can you explain why humans often ignore bearish factors in bull markets?,"It's human nature – people tend to disregard bad news or unfavorable conditions when the market is trending upwards. In a bull market, bear items are ignored, and bull news is given more weight. This is not just about being optimistic but also about being human."
"I was very bullish on cotton. It was hanging around twelve cents, running up and down within a moderate range. What was my reasoning behind this optimism?",I believed it could go beyond the upper resistance point if I gave it a little push.
"What did I learn from my experience with cotton, and how has that shaped my approach to trading in narrow markets?","In a narrow market, when prices are not getting anywhere to speak of but move within a narrow range, there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be up or down. The thing to do is to watch the market, read the tape to determine the limits of the get-nowhere prices, and make up your mind that you will not take an interest until the price breaks through the limit in either direction."
"I ended up losing a significant amount of money on cotton. What was the turning point for me, and what did I learn from this experience?",It cost me about two hundred thousand dollars. I was done with it. It wasn't very long after that when it began to go up and never stopped till it got to a price that would have meant a killing for me—if I hadn't been in such a great hurry to start.
"How did you decide to make money from the market, and what approach do you take?","I don't want any statistics or analyses of conditions. So I said: 'If you want to make some money out of wheat I can tell you how to do it.' My approach is to wait for the price to reach a certain limit, then buy when it crosses that limit. It's not about predicting the next big movement up or down, but rather about watching the market and making a decision based on the current situation."
What was your strategy when you told your friends to wait for wheat to cross $1.20 before buying?,"I wanted them to understand that I wasn't going to argue with the market or try to make sense of its behavior. My job is to speculate intelligently, not to gamble blindly. When I said 'wait' and told them to buy at $1.20, it was because I had watched the market for months and seen the price range between $1.10 and $1.20 without any significant movement. The next day's open at 1.20-1/2 confirmed my suspicions that the upward movement would push the price over the limit."
What was your initial reaction when you saw wheat prices moving in the opposite direction of what you had expected?,"I remember that one day was a holiday with us and all our markets were closed. Well, in Winnipeg wheat opened up six cents a bushel. When our market opened on the following day, it also was up six cents a bushel. The price just went along the line of least resistance."
Can you explain your trading system and how you determine when to buy or sell stocks?,"I merely learn the way prices are most probably going to move. I check up my own trading by additional tests, to determine the psychological moment. I do that by watching the way the price acts after I begin. When buying for a rise, I like to pay top prices, and when selling, I must sell low or not at all."
"How did you approach trading in cotton, and what was the basis of your theory?",In cotton I was very successful in my trading for a long time. I had my theory about it and I absolutely lived up to it. Suppose I had decided that my line would be forty to fifty thousand bales.
"What was your initial strategy for buying cotton, and how did you determine when to increase or decrease your holdings?","I bought one-fifth of my full line at first. If that didn't show me a profit, I knew I had started wrong and would cut my losses. I studied the tape to find opportunities to buy or sell, and if the market moved in my favor, I'd increase my holdings by buying more bales."
"How did your system for placing bets work, and what benefits did it provide you?","My system was simple: I'd buy a small exploratory bet when losing, so if I lost, I'd only lose that one. But when I won, I'd cash in on my big bet, which always put me in the profitable position."
"How did you develop your trading system, and what makes it effective?",I developed my system based on my own experience and approach to speculation. My old gentleman friend told me that my way of building a position was a good system for me because I'm naturally built that way - I don't worry about the money; it's just not a concern for me.
"Can you tell us about Pat Hearne, and how his trading approach differs from yours?","Pat Hearne was a clever chap who made money in stocks. He had an account with our office and traded using a system based on buying and selling shares as they moved up or down. He believed in sticking to a relatively sound betting method, similar to playing a game of chance like faro or roulette."
"What is your attitude towards losing money, and how do you minimize losses?","I believe that if I'm going to lose, I should only lose a small amount. If I win, I want to cash in on the big bet. Pat Hearne used to say he wouldn't lose more than one point, whether it came out of his original margin or from paper profits."
"What was your initial approach to the stock market, and how did you get started?",I went to work right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
How did your friend Roberts' decision to abandon Pat Hearne's system and try a new approach affect his trading results?,"He switched over to some other stock and because he had made a big stake, he thought he need not stick to Pat's way. When a reaction came, instead of cutting short his losses, he let them run as though they were profits. Of course every cent went. When he finally quit he owed us several thousand dollars."
"What lesson did you learn from your friend Roberts' experience, and how does it relate to the nature of speculation?","He hung around for two or three years. He kept the fever long after the cash had gone; but we did not object as long as he behaved himself. I remember that he used to admit freely that he had been ten thousand kinds of an ass not to stick to Pat Hearne's style of play. Well, one day he came to me greatly excited and asked me to let him sell some stock short in our office. He was a nice enough chap who had been a good customer in his day and I told him I personally would guarantee his account for one hundred shares. His account showed him a profit of fifteen thousand dollars in four days, but he didn't stick to his own proved system. That's the trouble with most of them,"
"What do you believe is the main enemy of a successful trader, and how do you describe it?","I believe that a speculator's chief enemies are always boring from within. It is inseparable from human nature to hope and to fear. Hope can lead to listening to false promises or getting caught up in short-term gains, while fear can cause you to get out too soon when the market goes your way."
What is your advice on how a trader should approach making decisions in the market?,"Instead of hoping, a successful trader must fear; instead of fearing, they must hope. You need to be afraid that your loss may develop into a much bigger loss and hopeful that your profit may become a big profit."
"Have you ever found success in the speculative game, and if so, what is your conclusion about it?","Yes, I have been successful for many years. However, after nearly thirty years of constant trading, I've reached a conclusion: A man may beat a stock or a group at a certain time, but no man living can beat the stock market."
"When did you start trading, and what markets were you initially involved with?","I started trading right after grammar school. I was initially involved with grain markets at Chicago, where I was bearish on corn and wheat."
What was the turning point for your decision to leave New York and go fishing from your yacht in Southern waters?,"It was actually my success in stocks that led me to consider leaving. However, a fellow operator named Stratton cornered the market on corn, which made me hesitant to proceed."
What is your conclusion about the stock market after nearly thirty years of trading?,"I've come to realize that no man living can beat the stock market. It's like horse racing – a person may win a specific race, but they cannot predict the overall outcome."
"When did you plan to go fishing, and how did your plans change due to a significant loss in corn?","I had made a killing in stocks, but at the last moment corn held me back. I was ready to go South on my yacht to fish to my heart's content from my own yacht, going wherever I wished whenever I felt like it. Everything was ready. However, after I cleaned up in stocks and was ready to go fishing, I found that wheat showed me a handsome profit, but in corn Stratton had run up the price and I had quite a loss."
"What was your strategy to deal with the difficult situation of being short on corn, considering you couldn't sell at the prevailing prices?",I must conduct a strategic retreat. I must buy back the ten million bushels I was short of and in so doing keep down my loss as much as I possibly could.
Why did Stratton's actions make it challenging for you to sell your corn at a good price?,"Stratton kept pretty close tabs on the short interest. He knew he had me, and I knew it quite as well as he did. But, as I said, I was hoping I might convince the weather that it ought to get busy and help me."
"When did you decide to take on Stratton in the grain market, and what was your initial strategy?",I must conduct a strategic retreat. I must buy back the ten million bushels I was short of and in so doing keep down my loss as much as I possibly could. The moment I heard the rumors about Armour being against Stratton it occurred to me that I might look to the Chicago traders for aid.
"How did you plan to profit from the situation, and what was your approach in buying and selling the grain?","The only way in which they could possibly help me was for them to sell me the corn that Stratton wouldn't. The rest was easy. First, I put in orders to buy five hundred thousand bushels of corn every eighth of a cent down. After these orders were in I gave to each of four houses an order to sell simultaneously fifty thousand bushels of oats at the market."
"What was the outcome of your plan, and how did you manage to cover your entire line of ten million bushels?",My dope on the psychology of the Chicago traders was absolutely correct. When they saw oats breaking on the scattered selling they promptly jumped on corn and sold it with great enthusiasm. I was able to buy six million bushels of corn in the next ten minutes. The moment I found that their selling of corn ceased I simply bought in the other four million bushels at the market.
"What was the net result of your maneuver, and how much did you make on the oats you sold short?",The two hundred thousand bushels of oats that I sold short to start the traders' selling of corn I covered at a loss of only three thousand dollars. That was pretty cheap
"Can you describe your experience buying six million bushels of corn in just ten minutes, and what psychological factors you exploited?","I found that when they saw oats breaking on the scattered selling, the Chicago traders would promptly jump on corn and sell it with great enthusiasm. I was able to capitalize on this by buying six million bushels of corn in the next ten minutes."
"What is the key difference between a professional trader like yourself and an amateur, according to your perspective?","The way a man looks at things makes or loses money for him in the speculative markets. A professional trader concerns himself with doing the right thing rather than making money, focusing on long-term positions rather than short-term gains."
"When did Addison Cammack become bearish, and how did J. Arthur Joseph find out about it?",I was bearish at the end of a bull market. It was J. Arthur Joseph who found out I had turned bearish; he knew me well enough to trust my judgment.
"What information did J. Arthur Joseph share with Addison Cammack, and how did Cammack react?","Joseph shared that William Rockefeller was selling stock - fifteen hundred shares every three-eighths of a point up. At first, I was skeptical and asked him to confirm the information, but he assured me it was true."
"Why did Addison Cammack initially distrust people who came to his office with news, gossip, rumors, tips, and lies?",I had grown accustomed to all sorts of people rushing into my office with false information; I'd become distrustful of them all.
What was Joseph's initial reaction when Cammack asked him if he was sure about buying more St. Paul shares?,"Joseph was adamant, saying 'Am I sure? Certainly I am sure! Do you think I am deaf?' He was convinced of the information and insisted that Cammack should take action."
"Why did Cammack's broker, Billy, buy 15 hundred St. Paul shares every three-eighths up, despite Joseph's suggestion to sell?",Cammack said 'I mean buy!' and told Billy to keep in touch with his reliable friend who had inside information about the market. Cammack was bearish on the market at that time.
How did Joseph's understanding of the market differ from Cammack's perspective?,"Joseph, thinking like a newspaper man and the general public, thought the price should go down due to inside selling by Mr. William Rockefeller's Standard Oil. In contrast, Cammack was bearish on the market and saw the buying as a sign that the trend was still up."
How did Cammack's bearish attitude toward the market influence his trading decisions?,Cammack didn't have to reflect on what was important to him. He saw instantly that he had been offered a chance to begin his big bear operations at the right time with the proper initial push.
What motivated Cammack to buy William Rockefeller's St. Paul stock instead of selling it?,"Cammack was buying because he saw that the tip gave him a vast supply of ammunition for his bear campaign, and he understood that this would help him benefit from a decline in the market."
"When did Percy Thomas lose everything in the cotton market, and how did he recover from it?","I believe it was March when Percy Thomas lost every cent in the cotton market. He paid off his creditors in full with interest and had a million dollars left for himself, which is truly remarkable."
"How did you first learn about Percy Thomas, and what qualities made him an inspiration to you?","I remember learning about Percy Thomas through the newspapers when he tried to corner cotton with Sheldon & Thomas. I was impressed by his pluck and brains, which led me to admire him immensely."
"What happened to Percy Thomas' deal in March cotton, and how did it affect the market?","The rumor about Percy Thomas' collapse of his deal in March cotton had everyone talking, but I didn't have a care in the world – I was having a grand old time cruising around Florida waters."
"How did you get into the stock market, and what was your first job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"What made you consider buying July cotton, and how did you approach this decision?","The news of Percy Thomas' latest misadventure turned my mind to the cotton market. I studied the trade papers to get a line on conditions. Everyone was bearish and selling July cotton, which led me to believe that the chaps who were short didn't have much time to cover their positions. I decided to buy July cotton after careful consideration."
"When did you start buying July cotton, and how much did you initially purchase?","I went to work when I was just out of grammar school. I quickly bought one hundred thousand bales of July cotton, which seemed like an easy task given that it came from many sellers."
"What happened on Monday, and how did you feel about the market's unexpected move?","On Monday, Liverpool was due to open up twenty points but instead came fifty points higher, exceeding our advance by 100%. I realized that my deductions had been sound and that I was trading along the line of least resistance."
What concerns did you have as a trader with such a large amount of July cotton to sell?,"I was concerned about finding a market for one hundred and forty thousand bales, but I wasn't letting go of any of my own cotton. I could detect no signs of an impending bear panic or blind stampede to cover."
"What was the situation with July cotton when you started selling, and how did it affect your plans?","I had cornered July cotton, which meant I owned most of it. The Liverpool cables made the market wild, but I knew that as long as I held on to my cotton, I'd be in a great position. However, when the article 'July Cotton Cornered by Larry Livingston' appeared in the papers, it created an opportunity for me to sell all 140,000 bales and secure top prices."
"How did you take advantage of the situation with July cotton, and what was your plan?","I saw a heaven-sent opportunity to get rid of my cotton when I read about it in the papers. The market was wild due to the article, so I let the traders sell my bales at the top prices of the day. All I did was see an opportunity and take it – I couldn't help but do so."
"What motivated you to sell all your cotton at 10 minutes after 10, and what was the outcome?","I let them have every one of my one hundred and forty thousand bales because I couldn't help it - there was a heaven-sent opportunity to get rid of my cotton. The traders made the market for me, and selling one hundred and forty-seven thousand bales without sending the price down was a trick beyond my powers."
"How did the publication of an article in The World impact your ability to sell your cotton, and what lesson did you learn from this experience?","If the World had not published that article I never would have been able to dispose of my line without sacrificing the greater portion of my paper profits. Selling one hundred forty-seven thousand bales was a trick beyond my powers, but the World story turned it for me very nicely."
"What is the most important lesson you can share with others who want to be successful traders, and how should they approach trading on a large scale?","You cannot hesitate. If you do you are lost. Neither can you try stunts like running up the price on the bears by means of competitive buying, for you may thereby reduce the absorbing capacity. A man must be on the lookout so alertly that when his chance sticks in its head at his door he must grab it."
"When did you meet Percy Thomas, and how did he become involved with your life after the July cotton deal?","I met Percy Thomas a day or two later than the big cotton deal. He was impressed by my scheme and didn't think I had planned it, but rather thought I was just lucky."
"What did Percy Thomas say about your deal in cotton, and how did he react to being called the 'Cotton King'?","He said that my deal was the slickest one ever put over, and that I knew exactly what I was doing. He even repeated back to me his own words, saying it was mighty slick. He didn't think I deserved the title of Cotton King myself."
Why did you tell your story in a way that wasn't meant to moralize about traders or seizing opportunities?,"I wanted to account for the vast amount of newspaper notoriety I received as a result of my deal in July cotton. My goal was simply to explain how I came to be known as the Cotton King, and it wasn't meant to emphasize any particular lesson or point."
"Who did you meet as a result of your newspaper notoriety, and what was significant about that meeting?","I met Percy Thomas, a remarkable man who played a crucial role in my life. That meeting was instrumental in shaping the story I'm sharing with you."
"When did you close your July cotton deal, and what kind of success did you expect from it?",I closed my July cotton deal more successfully than I had expected.
"Who was Percy Thomas, and why were his opinions highly regarded in the cotton market?",Percy Thomas was a man whose name was a household word wherever men took an interest in growing or buying or selling cotton. People quoted him to me because he had opinions that I received and read with unfailing regularity.
"Why did you agree to meet Percy Thomas at your office, and what was his interest in meeting you?","I agreed to meet Percy Thomas because he signed a letter requesting an interview. He came to my office the next day, and I had long admired him."
"When did you receive a request for an interview from Percy Thomas, and how did he come to know of your success in the cotton market?","I received the letter by mail long after I closed my July cotton deal more successfully than I had expected. Percy Thomas was someone I had long admired, and his name was a household word wherever men took an interest in growing or buying or selling cotton."
"What were your initial thoughts on forming a working alliance with Percy Thomas, and what concerns did you have about the partnership?",I told him frankly that I didn't think I could run in double harness and wasn't keen about trying to learn. But he insisted that it would be an ideal combination until I said flatly that I didn't want to have anything to do with influencing other people to trade.
"What were the terms of your proposed working alliance with this investor, and why did you ultimately reject his offer?","He proposed that I would share any information he gathered with him before passing it on to the public, and in return, I would do the actual trading. However, I didn't want to influence others to trade or run in 'double harness,' so I declined his offer."
"What drives your approach to trading, and how do you define a successful trade for yourself?","I get my pleasure out of matching my brains against other traders, without influencing others or capitalizing on my opinions. When I make money, it's only because I've backed my own opinions – if I made money in another way, I wouldn't consider it earned."
Can you explain the experience that led you to be more cautious about accepting influence or advice from others?,"I had a previous experience where someone talked me into doing something against my judgment and wishes. That made me realize how vulnerable I can be to persuasive personalities and attacks like greed, fear, and hope – although I try to avoid those common speculative ailments."
"What was the experience like when you were visited by an unfamiliar man in your private office, and how did it affect you?","I was surprised to see a stranger in my private office after hours. He seemed out of place, but I was too caught up in my own thoughts to react strongly. When he talked about buying Walter Scott's works, I signed the contract without fully understanding what I was getting into."
How did you initially perceive the book agent who convinced you to buy a set of Walter Scott's works for $500?,"He didn't exactly impress me with his charm or wit. His manner and speech were unremarkable, but he seemed to have an effect on me nonetheless. I thought I listened to what he had to say, but in reality, I don't recall the specifics of our conversation."
"How did you initially react to making a $500 mistake, and what was your first step in addressing the issue?","I didn't think much about losing money at first; instead, I focused on understanding why I made the mistake. To begin, I tried to size up the book agent who had convinced me, hoping to learn from my experience and avoid making a similar error in the future."
"How did you initially approach the situation with this salesman, and what was the outcome?","I went into the deal without knowing much about it, but I was eager to make a profit. The salesman seemed to know exactly what he was doing, and he even smiled at me as if we shared some kind of understanding. He told me that he couldn't take on my order because he didn't want to risk losing more money than he already had."
"Why did the salesman decline your offer, and what did you ask him next?","The salesman said he couldn't do it because his commission would be too high. I asked him how much commission he typically made on a deal like this, and he told me that he could only take a third of the total amount. I then offered him $200 cash to take back the contract if he agreed to make the trade."
What did the salesman reveal about your character and his business approach?,"The salesman told me that I was a 'first-class loser' who would naturally be drawn into making a bad deal. He said this because he knew my type of sport, but also implied that I had a certain... let's call it 'ambition' or drive to make more money. He even hinted that I wasn't just motivated by personal gain."
"What motivated me to sign on with this fellow, and what was my expectation of compensation?","I signed on because he convinced me that it was a good opportunity, but I was paid $200 for ten minutes' work, which seemed like a good deal at the time."
"How did your sales pitch differ from the usual commission-based sales approach, and what made you think it would be successful?","I sold J. P. Morgan a set of Walter Scott's novels, which I claimed was done with his own signature on the contract. The idea was to sell not only to people who hadn't bought from others but also to those who couldn't even see them."
"How did you respond when I questioned the legitimacy of your sales pitch, and what made me doubt my own judgment?","I simply told you that it was true and showed you a contract with J. P. Morgan's signature on it. You didn't seem to have any doubts at the time, which is why I thought it would work."
"How did J.P. Morgan get past security to sign a contract, and how is it similar to getting past your own security?",He got into Mr. Morgan's office by talking to the fellow at the door who wasn't supposed to let him in. The way he got into both places is the same - just talking to someone who isn't supposed to let you in.
"Why did J.P. Morgan tear up the contract, and what did it reveal about his character?",He tore up the contract because I took it without whining or complaining like he would have if he were in my place. He said it was a test of whether I would have taken it as he would have.
"What did J.P. Morgan offer you at the end, and why didn't you get the additional $200?",He offered me another $200 if I took the money without complaint like he had shown me how to take it. He said that's all there was to it - no secret or trickery involved.
"When did you take the book agent to see Mr. Ed Harding, and what did he ask you to do?",I took him to see Mr. Ed Harding's office and asked him to let me talk to him for three minutes by the clock. Then I was supposed to leave him alone with him.
"What did the book agent tell you when he came across you on a Sixth Avenue L-train, and what did he want from you?",He told me that he sold Mr. Harding two thousand dollars' worth of books that day I took him to see him. He didn't say anything about it before because Mr. Harding doesn't talk about business mistakes.
"How did you feel when the book agent said he expected you to do something for him, and what did he mean by 'the kind that never makes mistakes'?",I felt like I was being asked to do a favor. He meant that Mr. Harding is someone who doesn't make mistakes because it's bad business to do so; he always knows what he wants and nobody can tell him different.
"What did Mr. Livingston sell you two thousand dollars' worth of, and how did it affect your business?","He sold me two thousand dollars' worth of books that day, which ultimately led to an important meeting with Mr. Harding."
"How did Percy Thomas's persistence and charisma affect your interactions with him, despite initially declining his offers?","His persistent letters and invitation to see him convinced me to reconsider our business alliance, and I ended up seeing him frequently, finding it a pleasure to listen to his interesting insights."
"What can be inferred about Mr. Harding from your interactions with him, and how did he impact the sales of books?","Mr. Harding is a Tammany man who expects results, as evident from his order for ten sets of books. He's confident in himself and others, which made me decide to sell him something I didn't want to."
"What inspired you to take Percy Thomas up on his offer of help, and what did you learn from your interactions with him?","I was drawn in by his charm and the fact that he seemed to know so much. I learned a great deal about various subjects and how he presented his knowledge was truly impressive. He's a magnetic man who knows how to convince others, and I found myself wanting to listen to what he had to say."
"How did Percy Thomas's arguments affect your market views on cotton, and what did you ultimately decide to do?","He presented a wealth of facts and figures that made me question my own understanding of the market. At first, I was bearish on cotton, but he convinced me that there was more to it than I initially thought. His arguments eventually led me to cover my short position and go long, as his perspective had changed my mind about the market."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did you develop your skills?","I started working right after grammar school as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures and excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately."
"What led you to take the opposite trading position of Thomas Hearne, and how did this affect your investment decisions?","Thomas Hearne's facts and figures made me realize I had been basing my previous position on misinformation. His influence led me to go long in cotton, despite being bearish, and to cover, which ultimately made me take the opposite trading position."
"What was your mistake when buying cotton, and how did you attempt to correct it?","I bought cotton without proper analysis or experience, setting up an 'asinine play.' I attempted to correct this by increasing my line of wheat, but ultimately found myself in a difficult situation."
What was the impact of Thomas Hearne's influence on your trading style and principles?,"Thomas Hearne's influence made me deviate from my natural trading style. I allowed myself to be persuaded not to take my loss and to hold up the market, which was contrary to my trading principles and theories."
"When did you realize that your speculative commitments were overlarge, and what made you decide to lighten your load?","I remember doing some thinking while on rest at Bayshore, and it seemed to me that my speculative commitments were too big. I got feeling nervous, which made me decide to cut back on my losses by either selling the cotton or keeping the wheat."
"What was your mistake when trying to average a losing game, and what did you learn from it?","I sold my profitable wheat deal despite knowing that it showed a profit, while keeping the losing cotton deal. I learned that always selling what shows a loss and keeping what shows a profit is the wise thing to do - a principle I knew well but didn't follow in this case."
"Why did you continue buying more cotton after selling your profitable wheat deal, and what was going through your mind at that time?","I bought more cotton because I wanted to keep the price from going down. It seemed like a super sucker play, but I couldn't help myself - I kept putting up more money in hopes of preventing further losses."
"What motivated you to keep buying cotton despite losing money, and how much could you have potentially made if you had held on?","I bought more cotton to keep the price from going down. If I had kept it, I might have taken a profit of about eight million dollars."
"What was your experience like when you realized too late that you had made a foolish play, and how did it affect your financial situation?",I accumulated four hundred and forty thousand bales before I realised what I was doing. And then it was too late. So I sold out my line. I lost nearly all that I had made out of all my other deals in stocks and commodities.
"What lesson did you learn from your experience, and how did it affect your approach to trading?",To learn that a man can make foolish plays for no reason whatever was a valuable lesson. It cost me millions to learn that another dangerous enemy to a trader is his susceptibility to the urgings of a magnetic personality when plausibly expressed by a brilliant mind.
"When did you become a millionaire, and what was your strategy behind making that money?","I made my millions in less than a year by using brains, helped by luck. I had been successful by reversing the process of buying low and selling high."
"What happened when you needed $200,000 to cover your expenses, and how did you try to raise that money?","I ran into trouble when I needed a large sum of cash, and my only option was to take it out of the stock market. However, I knew this would limit my trading facilities, so I had to find another way to get the money."
"How did you view the average customer's hopes for making a profit in the stock market, and what was your experience with high-flyers who invested large sums of money?",The hope of making the stock market pay your bill is one of the most prolific sources of loss in Wall Street. I've seen cases where people have lost everything due to their determination to invest.
"How did you get your first job in the stock market, and what was your role?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"What type of investment did Bob Keown plan to make, and what was his reasoning behind it?","I made a judicious investment of a temporary character, James. That's how I planned to pay for my sable coat. It would be a good investment if the market bought it for me."
"Why did Bob Keown want a sable coat, and what was his comment when asked about it?",It would look particularly well on a man of my inches. And how did you say you were going to pay for it?
"What was your initial reaction when you considered buying a fur coat for the office, and who supported your idea?","I initially thought it would be a good idea to buy the fur coat to keep the office from going broke. However, my fellow brokers jeered at the idea, but Harding strongly approved of my intention."
"What is your perspective on individuals trying to make the stock market pay for personal expenses, and why do you think this approach is flawed?","I believe that trying to make the stock market pay for a sudden need is a futile endeavor. It's a folly that can lead to significant losses, as people are often after an immediate profit and fail to consider their true risk tolerance."
"What was the outcome of your attempt to make the stock market pay for the fur coat, and how did it affect your trading strategy?","Unfortunately, my persistence in this approach led to significant losses. I went into debt and lost what little money I had left from my cotton deal. It also made me continue trading and losing, until the end of my resources."
What was the fatal flaw in your trading strategy that led to you losing a significant amount of money?,"I fell victim to the fallacy of thinking that I was taking a fifty-fifty chance by stopping losses at two points, rather than acknowledging that it was a flawed approach. This led me to continue trading and accumulating debt."
How did your prolonged period of debt affect your trading career?,"I went into debt not only to my principal brokers but also to other houses, which continued to do business with me without requiring an adequate margin. This stayed with me from then on, further exacerbating my financial woes."
"What is your experience with trading, and what led you to continue investing despite repeated losses?","I've made some big mistakes in the market, particularly with my cotton deal. I've lost a lot of money on trades where there's only a fifty-fifty chance of making a profit. But I just couldn't help myself - I kept thinking that the stock market would eventually make money for me. It was a costly mistake, and it nearly ruined me."
"How did you initially start your career in the stock market, and what skills did you bring to the table?","I started working right after grammar school as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures, particularly with mental arithmetic - I even completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school. It served me well in my early career."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did it prepare you for a career as a stock operator?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did your experience with mental arithmetic help you in your trading career, and what were some of the challenges you faced?","My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately. In fact, I was so good with numbers that I completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school."
"What was your biggest trading mistake, and how did it affect you emotionally?","I went into debt, not only to my principal brokers but to other houses. That crowning folly of my career as a stock operator beat me. I lost what little my cotton deal had left me. It did even more harm, for I kept on trading and losing."
How did you feel when you realized you couldn't make good judgments on small trades after years of success with large positions?,"It scarcely seemed worth while being right when all you carried was a hundred shares of stock. After the habit of taking a big profit on a big line, I wasn't sure I would know when to take my profit on a small line. I felt weaponless."
"When did you realize that you needed to leave New York, and what motivated your decision?","I realized I needed to leave New York after experiencing a series of failures and feeling like I'd lost my sense of proportion. I was afraid of not being able to make good decisions when trading with smaller stakes, so I decided to go away and find myself again."
"What did you learn from your experiences in the bucket shops, and what did you realize you still needed to work on?","I learned a great deal about the game of stock speculation, but I also realized that I had not learned as much about human weaknesses. I understood that no mind is completely machinelike and can be affected by men and misfortunes at times."
How did you come to terms with your financial losses and what did you take away from the experience?,I studied my disaster in detail and was able to see where I had been silly. I realized that a man must know himself thoroughly if he wants to make a good job out of trading in speculative markets.
When did I decide to leave New York and seek a stake elsewhere?,"I left New York because I wasn't in good trading trim, feeling unhappy and unfulfilled. I wanted to find myself again by changing my environment."
"What was the reason for Lucius Tucker's telegram, and who did he ask me to come to New York to see?","Lucius Tucker knew about my financial situation and had a meeting arranged with a big banker in New York. He asked me to come quickly, as it would be beneficial to me."
"What prompted you to travel back to New York, despite not knowing what would happen?","I didn't like having quite so much mystery, but I knew Lucius was friendly and must have a good reason for talking the way he did. I wasn't faring so sumptuously in Chicago that it would break my heart to leave it."
Who sent you to New York and what was the nature of your meeting with Lucius?,"Lucius met me at the station and did not waste any time in telling me that he had sent for me at the urgent request of Mr. Daniel Williamson, of the well-known Stock Exchange house of Williamson & Brown."
What can be inferred about Dan Williamson's character based on his relationship with his brother-in-law Alvin Marquand?,"Dan Williamson was a senior member of the firm, which was founded by Egbert Williamson way back in the '70's. He had inherited a considerable fortune and didn't go after much outside business. There was one customer worth a hundred average customers, and that was Alvin Marquand, who was also the president of the great Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad system."
What was your first impression of Dan Williamson and the firm he worked for?,I thought Dan Williamson was a guaranty that nothing improper would be demanded of me. His character and the firm's reputation made me feel comfortable with the arrangement.
"Who was Alvin Marquand, and what was his relationship to Dan Williamson and the firm?",Alvin Marquand was a director in a dozen banks and trust companies and the president of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad system. He was also the brother-in-law of Dan Williamson.
"What kind of position had Lucius Dawson been offered by Dan Williamson, and what were your expectations?","Lucius had just accepted a position with Williamson & Brown as a circulating general business getter. I expected to be offered a similar position in Chicago, possibly as office manager."
"How did Mr. Williamson greet you when you met him, and what was his demeanor like?","Mr. Williamson greeted me very pleasantly, with polished manners and a kindly smile. He seemed friendly, helpful, and good-humored due to his wealth and education."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did you acquire such good mathematical skills?","I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in my early career."
"Why did Dan Williamson think you should only focus on the stock market, and what were his expectations for your business?","Dan Williamson thought that my forte was the stock market, that I was born for it and that I should not stray from it. He expected me to give him my stock business, but I told him I couldn't because I didn't have any money."
"How did Dan Williamson's approach in listening to you differ from what you were used to, and how did this affect your negotiations?","Dan Williamson listened in silence with an impassive face, which made me feel compelled to continue speaking. He often made me offer terms much more advantageous to him than I had intended, simply by his presence and listening. This is not because I was trying to induce better bargains, but rather because I like to know all the facts of the case."
"Why did Mr. Livingston offer to give you $25,000 as margin to trade stocks?",He wanted me to do my trading in his firm's office so that he could cover up his brother-in-law's operations by using my reputation as a plunger.
"What was the main reason for Mr. Livingston's offer, from your perspective?","I think it was because he wanted to have a big active trader in his office who could swing a big line on the short side, which I'm known for doing."
Why did you initially decline Mr. Livingston's offer?,"Because I didn't have any money to put up as margin, and he offered me cash instead of giving me credit with his firm."
"When did you decide to come back to trading, and what made you think you'd lost your knack?","I decided to come back to trading after a year and a half without making any big profits. I thought I had lost my knack of hitting the market right, but it seems I hadn't."
"What was the initial agreement with Dan Williamson, and why did you later regret not taking his money?","Dan Williamson lent me $25,000 to start trading. He told me not to think about paying him back until my account amounts to something, but I should have insisted on him accepting the money. I was too proud and didn't want to owe favors or kindnesses."
What was your average profit per week during those first three weeks of trading after coming back?,"My average profit per week was 150% during those first three weeks. It was a good active market, and I was able to recover my poise quickly."
"When did you learn the hard lesson about not letting people owe you money or favors, and how does it affect your trading decisions?","I learned that hard lesson when I didn't draw out the twenty-five thousand dollars my brother-in-law had advanced me. I felt obligated to pay back the favor in kind, which made me hesitant to make a profit. It's a moral obligation that can be mighty high-priced at times."
"What was your initial strategy when you turned bear and started selling short railroad stocks, including Chesapeake & Atlantic?","I put out a moderate short line in several railroad stocks, including Chesapeake & Atlantic. I was confident that the market would go lower and that my short line would be profitable."
"Why did you initially disagree with Dan Williamson's advice to wait on selling Chesapeake & Atlantic short, despite his warning that it was a bad play?","I disagreed because I was bearish on the whole market and felt comfortable with my moderate short line. However, Dan's advice came from the brother-in-law of the chairman of the board, which made me hesitate to go against his wishes."
"What was the initial advice given to you by Dan Williamson, and why did it resonate with you?","He advised me not to sell Chesapeake & Atlantic stock short until he told me it was safe to do so. I took his advice because he's the brother-in-law of the chairman of the board, and I had a great deal of respect for him."
"What happened after you followed Dan Williamson's advice, and how did he help you recover from your losses?","After I sold my shares short based on his advice, I ended up owing the firm $150,000. However, Dan came through for me by buying me out of the ten thousand shares of Southern Atlantic that had lost value. He essentially wiped out the debt and gave me a small credit balance."
"What was the experience like when Dan Williamson bought ten thousand shares of Southern Atlantic for you, and how did it affect you?","Dan Williamson's generosity and encouragement were a welcome change from what I had experienced before. He took care of my debt with profits from another deal, but what really got to me was realizing that I had been used by him. It made me angry, but more so that I hadn't seen it coming sooner."
"What did you learn from your experience in Dan Williamson's office, and how did it change your approach to the stock market?","I learned a valuable lesson about being careful not to let gratitude cloud my judgment. I had been so grateful for Dan's help that I tied my own hands by not fully exploring the opportunities available to me. Since then, I've made sure to keep my emotions in check and make the most of every opportunity."
"How did you lose money and experience valuable lessons from your trading, according to you?","I have always considered that when I lose money in the stock market, I have learned something. The money really went for a tuition fee, so that the loss is not a significant setback. However, there was one opportunity that hurt me deeply - losing a great chance to make millions."
"What happened when you were offered an opportunity to trade in Dan Williamson's office, and how did it affect your trading career?","I had to do what Dan Williamson wished done. It was unsatisfactory business, like dealing with a relative. After that, there was practically no opportunity for me to make big money. The market flattened out, and I not only lost all my money but got into debt again."
"How did you reflect on your trading decisions, particularly after the experience in Dan Williamson's office?","I learned that the weaknesses to which a speculator is prone are almost numberless. I realized that it was improper and unwise for me to allow myself to be influenced by any consideration and act against my own judgment. As a speculator, my business is to back my own judgment."
"What was your initial job in the stock market, and how did you develop your skills?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
How did your mathematical abilities help you succeed in the early days of your career?,"My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately. In fact, I was so good with numbers that I completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school."
"What role did Dan Williamson play in your early career as a stock operator, and how did he benefit from having you?","Dan covered my Chesapeake & Atlantic stock because he knew Marquand's illness was incurable. By tying me up, Dan helped the estate liquidate Marquand's speculative holdings, which ultimately benefited him more than me."
How did your decision to limit your trading activities affect you personally and financially?,"I could have made so much money if I hadn't felt bound by decency. Instead of operating actively on the bear side, I was effectively paid off by Dan Williamson, which put me into debt and delayed my recovery for several years."
"What experience in the stock market cost you a disproportionately high price as a lesson, and how long did it take for you to recover?",My most unfortunate experience was when Dan Williamson tricked me into getting into debt. It took several years for me to recover from that experience.
"How did Dan Williamson outsmart you in the market, and what made him so effective as a stock operator?","Dan Williamson was a very shrewd boy who could think ahead. He sized me up carefully and planned to hit my vulnerable spot in order to reduce me to complete inoffensiveness in the market. He did everything without actually taking any money from me, but it still cost me a lot."
"What made you leave your job at Williamson & Brown's office, and what challenges did you face afterwards?","I left the office because I wanted to make a name for myself in the stock market. However, after I left, I faced a long period of unemployment with no money to be made, which was extremely difficult for me."
"How did you feel about being out of work and facing a difficult financial situation, and what do you think caused it?","To be honest, I felt like I was in 'Dutch with destiny.' It seemed like the market had turned against me, but I didn't believe I had done anything wrong. I thought I had made responsible decisions and wasn't guilty of any major mistakes."
"What inspired you to start trading, and what was your first job in the stock market?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did you handle your financial struggles during those four lean years, and what motivated you to keep trading?","I plugged along, trying to make a stake and succeeding only in increasing my indebtedness. I didn't always lose, but I never made enough to allow me materially to reduce what I owed. Finally, as things got worse, I felt the beginnings of discouragement for the first time in my life."
"What was your approach to trading during that difficult period, and how did you stay motivated?",I studied my problem. It was plain that the only way out of my troubles was by making money. To make money I needed merely to trade successfully. I had so traded before and I knew it.
When did you realize you needed to change your approach to dealing with your financial troubles?,I finally felt the beginnings of discouragement when things got worse and I couldn't pay my debts. That's when I decided to study my problem and find a way out.
"What was the main cause of your financial troubles, according to your own analysis?","I realized that my main trouble came from worrying over the money I owed. It wasn't just the consciousness of being indebted, but also the mental discomfort it caused me."
How did you deal with the creditors who were constantly following you and demanding information about your winnings?,"I dealt with them by not giving in to their demands. I knew they thought I was concealing assets, but I didn't have any. I just ignored them and focused on finding a way to pay my debts."
"Who were the creditors that haunted me constantly, demanding their money from me?","My personal friends and old acquaintances who owed me money. They would follow me around, eager to know about my winning trades and collect their debts."
"Why did I decide to go through bankruptcy, despite being reluctant to do so?",Because it was the only way for me to relieve my mind of the worry and stress caused by owing money to creditors. I realized that I couldn't pay them back unless I made more money through trading.
What did I tell my creditors when I explained my situation to them?,"That I was not going to pay them because I didn't want to, but rather because it would be in the best interest of both myself and them for me to go through bankruptcy. This way, I could make money and pay off my debts in the future."
"What motivated you to finally address your debts, and what was the outcome?","I realized that I couldn't be myself while being harassed by these debts. It's humiliating to see one's financial struggles in the newspapers. Thankfully, my creditors agreed to release me from over a million dollars' worth of debt, but there were two minor creditors who wouldn't sign off."
"What was the experience like for you when your debts became public knowledge, and how did it affect you?","Seeing my financial struggles in the newspapers was extremely mortifying. I felt ashamed to go out after reading the article. However, after some time passed, I felt a great sense of relief knowing that I wasn't being harassed by people who didn't understand the demands of stock speculation."
"What was your next step after resolving your debt issues, and what were the conditions like during the Stock Exchange's closure?","With my mind now free from debts, I decided to get another stake in trading. The Stock Exchange had been closed since July 31st, 1914, and Wall Street was in a slump with no business happening for a long time."
"When did you decide to start trading again after feeling relieved and free from debt, and who was your first person to turn to for help?","I decided to start trading again in February 1915, and my first person to turn to for help was Dan Williamson."
"What was the initial stake you were offered by Dan Williamson, and how did you feel about it?","Initially, Dan Williamson offered me a stake of just five hundred shares, which I felt was not very promising. I was a little sore that he didn't give me a decent stake."
"What were your initial plans for trading, and why did you want to start with a better line?","I intended to trade conservatively at first, aiming for a line a little better than five hundred shares. This would have made my financial recovery easier and quicker."
When did you realize you had the chance to come back into the market and how much was your stake?,"I realised that there was my chance to come back when I left Dan Williamson's office. My stake consisted of merely an offer to carry five hundred shares for me, which meant I had no leeway or room for error."
"What was the key psychological moment you were waiting for in 1915, and why was it so important?","I was waiting for the exact psychological moment when Bethlehem Steel crossed par. This was crucial because I had to make real money on my first play, and without sufficient trading capital, I wouldn't be able to afford to take risks."
"What was your initial strategy when you decided to buy Bethlehem Steel, and what stock did you consider buying earlier in 1915?","I bought Bethlehem Steel just after it crossed $100, waiting until it reached parity of $199. Earlier in 1915, I considered buying Anaconda when it crossed $200."
"How did you manage to resist the temptation to trade during the early days of your return to active trading, and what was the turning point for you?",I had to restrain myself from trading impulsively by remembering my experiences in bucket shops. The turning point came when I realized that every point the stock went up meant five hundred dollars I hadn't made yet.
"What was the moment of truth for you, and what did you do when Bethlehem Steel reached $98?","When Bethlehem Steel reached $98, I knew it would break through to $100. The excitement was palpable, but I remained calm and waited for the stock to cross parity."
When did you finally get a decent stake together and start taking chances in the stock market?,"I sat tight for six weeks, waiting for the right moment to take a chance. Once I had a decent stake together, I could afford to take risks."
"What was your experience like when you bought 1,000 shares of Bethlehem Steel at $98 and then watched them close at $114 or $115 the next day?","It was a great feeling! After waiting six weeks for the right moment, I finally got in on the action. When the stock shot up to $145 the next day, I knew I had made the right decision."
"How did you feel when the news of the Lusitania's torpedoing reached you, and how did it affect your trading experience?","It was a kick in the solar plexus. The loss was significant, but I knew that even professional speculators can't avoid unprofitable accidents. It taught me to stay grounded and not get too caught up in my own success."
"What was your financial situation at the end of 1915, and how did you manage to achieve consistent success throughout most of that year?","I ended up with a balance of around $140,000 at my brokers' office, which was all I actually made for the year. Despite being consistently right on the market, I wasn't able to foresee some reverses and lost money as a result."
"What were your thoughts on the bull market of 1915, and how did you approach investing during that time?","I was very lucky and rampantly bullish in a wild bull market. It seemed like everything was going my way, so I just focused on making money. The war-bride boom was naturally developed and proved to be unprecedentedly profitable for the general public."
"What was your approach to predicting market trends, and how did you decide when to change your strategy?","I followed my instincts and looked for warning signals that indicated a change in the market. I didn't get too attached to either side of the market; instead, I focused on being right. When I noticed that stocks which had been leading the market reacted several points from the top and failed to come back, I knew it was time to adjust my trading tactics."
"When did you notice that stocks which had been leading the market stopped advancing, and what led you to this realization?","I noticed that those stocks which had been the leaders of the market reacted several points from the top and didn't come back. Their race was evidently run, and it clearly necessitated a change in my trading tactics."
"What were your next steps when you realized the bull market for some stocks was over, and how did you adjust your strategy?","I sold the leaders that had stopped advancing, putting out a short line of five thousand shares in each. Then I went long of the new leaders. The stocks I was short of didn't do much, but my long stocks kept on rising."
"How did you determine when to shift from being bullish to bearish, and what prompted you to take this stance?","I felt certain that the next big money was going to be made on the down side, but I knew the time for being a rampant bear wasn't yet. The tape merely said that patrolling parties from the main bear army had dashed by, so there was no sense in being more royalist than the king."
"When did I first start buying and selling stocks, and how many shares did I initially put out?","I went long of the new leaders after putting out a short line of five thousand shares in each of them. Later, I increased my position to sixty thousand shares by diversifying into twelve different stocks."
"What was my strategy when I decided to go bearish, and how did I adjust it based on market conditions?","When the market became weak, I doubled up in shorting my positions. This allowed me to ride out the bear market and wait for it to unfold in my favor."
"How did I react when the market broke badly after the famous 'leak' news, and what was the outcome of my trading strategy?","I covered my losses by buying back the stocks that had broken badly. Fortunately, the big break came at a time when I could turn my paper profits into real money."
When did you decide to take a position in the market based on your experience of thirty years as a trader?,I base my positions on the line of least resistance. I've found that such accidents are usually along that line.
"What is the key principle you advise traders to follow when selling, and why is it wise to do so?",Never try to sell at the top. It isn't wise. Sell after a reaction if there is no rally.
"When did you make a decision to buy fifteen thousand bales of cotton, and what triggered that decision?","I made the decision to buy fifteen thousand bales of cotton at 2:25 in the afternoon, after I believed that peace was impending. My belief about Wilson's success with bringing about peace led me to take a position in cotton."
"What happened when you bought the cotton, and how did it affect your profits?","When I bought the cotton, it opened down five hundred points the next morning. This meant an overnight loss of three hundred and seventy dollars for me, but it also provided a heaven-sent opportunity to cover all my shorts profitably."
"What was your approach to trading in this situation, and how did you manage your risks?","I followed my old system of trading, which involved buying my full line. I also took the time to wait for the market to open the next day before taking any action. This allowed me to cover all my shorts profitably when the market opened in an uproar."
How did you handle the unexpected turn of events that led to a significant loss in your cotton position?,"I didn't like to take the loss, but I decided not to cover my short on cotton. Instead, I figured it was just bookkeeping and that my overall profit would be slightly less than expected. I saved $400,000 if I had covered earlier, but I chose to hold onto the position."
"Can you explain how your positions in stocks, wheat, and cotton were based on different market expectations?","Yes, my main position was correct, and I benefited from an unexpected event. In stocks and wheat, I expected prices to go down with peace, but they went up instead. In cotton, I bet on Mr. Wilson's success in his peace negotiations, which ultimately led to a loss."
What was the impact of the German military leaders' actions on your overall strategy?,"It was the unexpected event – the German military leaders making me lose the cotton bet – that helped me clean up in all three lines. If things had turned out as I expected, I would have been 100% right."
"When did you return to New York and pay back all the money you owed, which was over a million dollars?","I returned to New York early in 1917 and paid back all the money I owed, which was over a million dollars. It was a great pleasure to me to pay my debts."
"Why did you decide not to pay off your debts in dribs and bits or to one man at a time, but rather in full to all at once?","I didn't wish to pay off my obligations in dribs or to one man at a time, but in full to all at once. So as long as the market was doing all it could for me I just kept on trading on as big a scale as my resources permitted."
What motivated you to put a pretty fair amount into annuities after paying off your debts?,"I made up my mind I wasn't going to be strapped and uncomfortable and minus a stake ever again. Of course, after I married I put some money in trust for my wife. And after the boy came I put some in trust for him."
"When did you pay off your debts and come back to the stock market, and what motivated you to do so?",I paid off my debts after I had a chance encounter with someone who heard that I had paid off all my other creditors. This motivated me to come back to the stock market. I also made up my mind not to be strapped and uncomfortable again.
"How did you ensure that your wife's trust fund would remain safe from your spending habits, and what was your reasoning behind this?","I put some money in trust for my wife after I married, and later for our child. My reason for doing so was to protect them from me, as I knew I would spend anything I could get my hands on. By placing the funds in a trust, I ensured that they would be safe from my market needs and even from my own desires."
What motivated you to put money in trust for your wife and child?,"I did it because I wanted to ensure their financial security, especially after having a boy. I was concerned that the stock market might take away from me, but more importantly, I knew that people will spend whatever they can get their hands on, so I put money aside for them to keep them safe."
What do you consider the most significant risks a speculator faces in the market?,"I think the biggest risk is the unexpected, even the unexpectable. Prudent men should be willing to take calculated risks if they want to succeed. It's like life itself – it's a gamble from birth to death, and I can accept my own lack of foresight without being vindictive about it."
How do you approach business and competing with others in the market?,"I don't see my business as a fight or a battle, but rather as tests of business vision. I try to stick to facts and reason logically, and if I make mistakes, I accept them and pay for them. But I do object to losing money when I'm right."
"What is your attitude towards dishonesty in the market, and how do you protect yourself from it?","I believe honesty is always the best policy, even in places like bucket shops. To protect myself, I keep an eye on the dealer and don't play games where I need to watch him closely. However, against welshers, a decent man is powerless."
"What is your approach to business decisions, as advised by Bernard M. Baruch?","I try to stick to facts and facts only, and govern my actions accordingly. I don't want to be swayed by emotions or personal biases."
"How did you handle the post-war market boom in stocks, and what was your strategy for profiting from it?",I took advantage of the boom and made a big play in the stock market. I was lucky to be able to pay off my debts and come out ahead by 1917.
"What factors led you to consider commodities as a speculative opportunity, given the pre-war price surge?","I noticed that coffee prices were selling below pre-war levels, which seemed like an anomaly. The German and Austrian submarine operations must have reduced commercial shipping, leading to a surplus of raw coffee in this country, which kept prices low."
"When did you start considering coffee as a speculative investment, and what was your initial strategy?","I started my buying operations in the winter of 1917. At that time, coffee was selling below pre-war prices, which made it an attractive opportunity for me."
"How did you initially approach buying coffee, and what led you to believe it would increase in price?","I bought coffee as an investment, not a speculation. I knew it would take time to cash in, but I believed it would yield a good profit. The price was low, and I expected the market to follow the trend of other commodities."
"What happened when you first started buying coffee, and how did that impact your strategy?","The market remained inactive for nine long months, and my contracts expired without me making a profit. Despite this, I was confident in my views and continued to buy more coffee."
"How did the German submarine attacks affect the price of coffee, and what led you to change your strategy?","The submarine attacks led to a reduction in ships available for commercial purposes, causing a surplus of coffee. This eventually drove up the price, as the market absorbed the excess supplies."
"I first became bullish on coffee when its price was practically at pre-war levels, and then carried it for 214 days. What were my expectations from this investment?","I expected to make a killing because I was clearly right about the market going up. I had invested in options and was carrying a big line, so I knew I would make money if the market advanced sufficiently."
"What happened when the market didn't experience an abrupt reversal of form, and why did my profit fail to materialize?","The sellers of the contracts I held, mostly German roasters, knew what was in store for them and devised a way to welch on their obligations. They rushed to Washington and got help from the Government, which had plans to prevent further profiteering in necessities."
What prompted you to sell out all your contracts on coffee after the Price Fixing Committee's ruling?,I was forced to sell out my contracts because the committee's decision meant that the Coffee Exchange would have to go out of business. I had no other choice but to liquidate my position.
"How did you feel about the Price Fixing Committee's ruling, and what do you think was the real reason behind the price increase in coffee?","I don't have much sympathy for the committee's decision. In hindsight, I realize that the price of coffee would have advanced regardless of who held it - due to a dwindling surplus and diminishing importations. It wasn't the speculators' actions, but rather the market forces, that drove up prices."
"How did you view the Price Fixing Committee's decision to fix the price of coffee, and what impact did it have on the market?","I didn't think it was a good idea for the committee to force the Coffee Exchange to close just then. If they had let coffee alone, the price would have risen anyway due to supply and demand issues caused by German submarines destroying ships. Instead, the high price created an incentive for supplies to come in, but ultimately benefited only the roasters with patriotic names and ancestry."
"What did you consider your coffee deal to be, and how did you view its relationship to speculation versus investment?","I thought my coffee deal was the most legitimate of all my trades in commodities. I considered it more of an investment than a speculation, as I held it for over a year. However, even though I didn't gamble like some other traders, the committee's actions ultimately benefited only those who did benefit from profiteering."
"What was the outcome when the Coffee Exchange resumed business after being closed by the Price Fixing Committee, and how did it affect the market?","When coffee trading resumed, the price ended up at twenty-three cents per pound. This low price was due to a small supply of coffee, which was a result of the high price set by the committee having discouraged importations."
Can you describe your experience with the Price Fixing Committee and how it affected your trading strategy?,"The Price Fixing Committee fixed the price of the only commodity that had not advanced. They protected the public against profiteering before it started, but not against the inevitable higher Prices that followed."
What was your experience with exchange committees making rulings that changed trading rules without warning?,"I have suffered from the action of exchange committees making rulings that changed trading rules without warning. But in those cases my own position, while technically right, was not quite so sound commercially as in my coffee trade."
How did you deal with the criticism and gossip surrounding your trading strategies?,I suffered from silly gossip. The professionals in Wall Street and the newspaper writers got the habit of blaming me and my alleged raids for the inevitable breaks in prices. At times my selling was called unpatriotic—whether I was really selling or not.
"What drives your alleged raids for inevitable breaks in prices, and how do you respond to those who call them unpatriotic?","I raid stocks because I believe they're overvalued and will eventually correct themselves. When people call my selling 'unpatriotic,' it's likely because they don't understand the market or are trying to justify their own losses."
"How do you explain sudden stock price declines, especially when they occur during a 'raid' by an operator?","Most sudden declines aren't caused by professional traders like myself. They're often the result of genuine market corrections or general conditions that make it difficult for insiders to buy. When there is unjustified short selling, though, it can sometimes lead to a rally rather than a decline."
"What's the difference between a bear tip and an inverted tip, and how do you respond to those who receive inverted tips for losing money?","A bear tip is a genuine warning to sell short. An inverted tip, on the other hand, is just a way to keep people from selling when they should be. I think it's wise to get out of the market when prices are breaking badly, but only because there's an unknown reason for the move – not because it's the result of a raid by someone like me."
"How did you explain losses to speculators, and what is the difference between a bear tip and an inverted tip?","I explained losses by saying that some plunger's operations probably was invented as an easy way of supplying reasons to those speculators who, being nothing but blind gamblers, will believe anything that is told them rather than do a little thinking. A bear tip is distinct, positive advice to sell short, whereas an inverted tip serves merely to keep you from wisely selling short by giving you an unknown reason to get out."
"What was your initial response to people's desire for tips, and how do you think they use them?","I find it amusing that people crave tips not only to receive them but also to give them. There's greed and vanity involved, and it's entertaining to see intelligent people fishing for tips. The tip-giver doesn't worry about the quality; they just want anyone who will take a tip."
"How do you view the role of tips in promoting a promoter or manipulator's business, and what is their perspective on this?","For them, a good flow of tips is considered sublimated publicity work, the best merchandising dope in the world. They believe that since tip-seekers and tip-takers are invariably tip-passers, tip-broadcasting becomes an endless-chain advertising. The tipster-promoter thinks no human being can resist a tip if properly delivered."
"How did you initially react when Borneo Tin was brought out, and what was your strategy in buying shares?","I bought ten thousand shares during the first hour of the first day. I knew what the pool's resources were and what they had planned to do, but I also knew what the public was capable of."
"What mistake did the promoters make with Borneo Tin's initial offering, despite taking advice from a clever banker?",The only mistake the members of the pool made came from inexperience. They didn't know what the stock market was capable of during a crazy boom and weren't intelligently liberal.
"How did you perceive the public's reaction to Borneo Tin's initial offering, and what was your approach to profiting from it?",The public was buying anything that was adequately tipped. Investments were not wanted; the demand was for easy money – sure gambling profit.
"When did I join the Borneo pool, and why didn't I accept their offer to join?","I had been approached to join the pool, but I declined their offer because I prefer to trade on my own information and follow my own methods. If there's any market manoeuvring to be done, I like to do it myself."
What was my strategy when buying ten thousand shares of Borneo Tin during its initial day?,"I bought ten thousand shares during the first hour of the first day, knowing what the pool's resources were and what they had planned to do, as well as understanding the public's capacity for demand."
"How did the promoters react when they realized I held a significant portion of their shares, and what was their subsequent strategy?","When they found out that I had acquired my ten thousand shares, they decided it would be a mistake to lose so much money by selling at such high prices. Instead, they tried to shake me out by giving up on their bull operations and putting up the price without losing any more stock."
"What was the outcome of my holding onto my shares, and how did it affect the pool's strategy?","I held onto my ten thousand shares until they reached $120, at which point I let them have my shares. This checked the rise, and the pool managers let up on their jacking-up process. However, when the bull market ended, the pool was compelled to market what stock it could on the way down."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did it help prepare you for your future career?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did you initially meet Mrs. Livingston, and what advice did Mr. Wisenstein give her about buying Borneo Tin stocks?","I met Mrs. Livingston at a dinner party where she met the president of the Borneo Tin Company, Mr. Wisenstein. He told her to buy as much Borneo Tin stock as she wished, and he assured her that if she did so, she would not lose a cent."
"What was unusual about the advice given by Mr. Wisenstein to Mrs. Livingston, and what made you give her $500 from your recent earnings?","What was unusual was that Mr. Wisenstein had never before advised anyone to buy anything in his life, but he was so confident in the Borneo Tin stock that he wanted to share his secret with Mrs. Livingston. I gave her $500 because it was a curious coincidence - we were both in Palm Beach at the time, and I made some money at Gridley's, which I used to gift her."
"I gave my confidence to a woman, Mrs. Livingston, regarding the stock Borneo Tin, and I assured her that if she bought as much as she wished, she would not lose a cent. Why did you give your confidence to her, and what was the amount of money she had to invest?","I gave my confidence to Mrs. Livingston because I wanted someone to benefit from the rise in Borneo Tin's stock price, rather than some stranger. She had $500 to invest, which was a generous sum for me to entrust her with."
"Mrs. Livingston went to Harding's office and asked them to buy as much Borneo Tin as possible with her $500, on the condition that she wouldn't tell her husband about it. What was the price of a share of Borneo Tin when Mr. Haley bought her shares, and how much did the stock close at that day?",Mr. Haley bought Mrs. Livingston 100 shares of Borneo Tin for $108 per share. The stock closed that day at an advance of three points from its opening price.
When did you start feeling bearish on the general market and what drew your attention to Borneo Tin?,I had been getting more and more bearish on the general market. The unusual activity in Borneo Tin drew my attention to it.
"How much did you buy of Borneo Tin for Mrs. Livingston, and what was the closing price that day?","I bought her a hundred shares of Borneo Tin for the five hundred dollars she gave me. The stock closed at an advance of three points, so it must have been around $108."
What happened when Haley tried to sell Mrs. Livingston's shares after she had already bought them?,"Haley told her that he couldn't sell the shares without consulting her again, and that they would have to be diplomatic in their conversation about it."
What happened when you saw Mrs. Livingston's situation and how did she react?,"When I saw what had happened, I realized that Wisenstein had tricked me into buying more shares than he intended for himself. The lady was in a difficult spot because she had recently received an unearned five hundred dollars and couldn't afford to lose it."
"How did you handle the situation with Mrs. Livingston, and what advice did you give her?","I told her that she was being foolish and should keep her hands off the deal. I gave her back her five hundred dollars, and she left happy. It was a clever trick by Wisenstein, but it ultimately went wrong."
What did you think of Wisenstein's plan to sell Mrs. Livingston shares without telling her about his intentions?,"I thought it was one of the most cleverly planned and artistically propelled tips I've ever heard of, but it went wrong because Mrs. Livingston was in a difficult spot and couldn't afford to lose money."
How did you feel when you realized that Wisenstein had tricked you?,"I felt deceived by Wisenstein's plan, but I also knew that it was part of his strategy to test me. He wanted to see how I would react in a difficult situation."
"When was Mrs. Livingston and Wisenstein's tip about Borneo first shared with you, and what was the outcome?","She told me the whole story, so I just said to her: 'You foolish little girl, you keep your hands off this deal.' She promised that she would, and so I gave her back her five hundred dollars and she went away happy. The stock was par by that time."
"What is Jesse Livermore's stance on trading based on tips, and why does he think it's a bad idea?","I have always seemed to me the height of damn foolishness to trade on tips. It is not so much greed made blind by eagerness as it is hope bandaged by the unwillingness to do any thinking. Tip-takers are like drunkards, always looking forward to those jags which they consider indispensable to their happiness."
How did my mathematical skills help me in my early career?,"My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately. In fact, I was so good with numbers that I completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school."
What do you think is the main difference between giving tips to others versus sharing your own opinions or insights?,"I believe it's the difference between hope and thinking. When I give tips, people follow blindly without questioning or analyzing. But when I share my views, they find trouble listening and get annoyed that I'm not providing a 'direct and specific tip' like some kind of philanthropist."
How did your acquaintance react to you never giving tips or putting friends into investments?,"My broker friend was upset, thinking I was selfish and cold-blooded. But when he bought shares based on a tip from the newspaper man who claimed it came from a good source (later revealed to be his own father-in-law), he lost money and got vindictive."
"Why did your broker friend buy a thousand shares of G.O.H. based on the tip from his father-in-law, Mr. Westlake?","He bought the shares because he thought the tip was from a good source, and he believed that the farther away the source, the purer the tip."
What happened to your broker friend's investment in G.O.H. after Mr. Westlake gave him the tip?,"The price of G.O.H. rose significantly, and he lost thirty-five hundred dollars before he could stop his loss."
When did I first meet John W. Gates and what was our conversation about?,"I met John W. Gates after he caught up with me on the street. He thanked me for a tip I had given him on Reading, but we both knew that I hadn't actually given him any advice. Instead, he bought the stock and made sixty thousand dollars."
What was Mr. W. A. Rogers telling you about war with Spain and its impact on the market?,"Mr. Rogers told me that his broker friend was debating whether to buy or sell stocks due to the uncertainty of a potential war with Spain. He explained how the broker's anxiety had caused him to take off his hat, wiping his fevered brow in the process."
What impression did Mr. Rogers' story have on me?,"Mr. Rogers' story made me think that I would be a rich man if I had his brains and insight into the market. It was an admiring comment, but also somewhat wistful, as I realized how much more knowledge and experience he possessed than I did."
"What was the turning point for W. A. Rogers when deciding whether to buy or sell stocks, according to your story?","He found a gold 'WAR' letter in his hat, which gave him the hunch he needed and led him to sell a raft of stock before war was declared."
How did Bert Walker's tip from an insider about the Atlantic & Southern stock lead to your investment decision?,"He told me that the directors were going to vote for a dividend increase, which led me to buy a couple of thousand shares. However, I later found out that he had forgotten to tell me about a change in plans and gave me another tip after it was too late."
"When did I first start working in the stock market, and what was my first job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
What happened to the stock price of Atlantic & Southern after a dividend was passed?,"The stock broke six points in the first six minutes of trading Friday morning, making it a double, riveted, lead-pipe cinch to buy A. & S. now."
How did Bert Walker and Hood initially react when they bought the stock?,"They were going to make a killing. The stock had been tipped for a rise before, so they bought five thousand shares, joint account. They expected it would be a sure thing."
What happened to Hood's decision to sell out their shares after the stock broke badly?,"He sold out their five thousand shares, and when he got through, Bert Walker was furious and wanted to send him a telegram that would 'show him what I think of him'."
What is your secret to making money in the stock market?,"I never buy at the bottom and I always sell too soon. That's my secret, and I stick to it. I've found that making money is not difficult; it's just a matter of understanding what you're doing."
What kind of investor do you think is most successful?,"The wisest investor I ever knew was a man who began by being a Pennsylvania Dutchman and followed it up by coming to Wall Street. He believed in asking his own questions and doing his own research, rather than relying on others' opinions or data."
"What inspired you to sell all your Atchison holdings after meeting with President Reinhart, and what led you to buy Delaware, Lackawanna & Western afterwards?","I sold my Atchison holdings because I noticed that President Reinhart was wastefully using expensive paper for his calculations. He would write down figures on fine linen paper with engraved letterheads, but then crumple it up and throw it away without a second thought. This struck me as the kind of reckless behavior I wouldn't want to reward in an assistant. Later, I bought Delaware, Lackawanna & Western because I saw an opportunity to make a lucky swap."
"How did you decide to believe the allegations about Mr. Reinhart's management, and what made you think he was not telling the truth?","I decided to believe the people who were saying that Mr. Reinhart was an extravagant manager because I noticed his behavior with the expensive paper. He would reach for a fresh sheet every time he wanted to show me something, which seemed unnecessary and wasteful. When he denied the allegations and then provided me with exact financial information, I realized he was being dishonest about it."
"How did you come to believe that the management of the D.L.& W. company was extravagant, and what led you to sell your Atchison stock?","It struck me that if that was the kind of man the D. L. & W. had for president, the company was managed economically in all departments. The president would see to that! Of course I knew the company was paying regular dividends and had a good property. I sold what Atchison stock I held."
"What did you observe about President Sam Sloan's office habits, and how did it reflect on the company's management?","His office was always open. Nobody could walk into the general offices of the D. L. & W. in those days and not see the president of the company seated at his desk. Any man could walk in and do business with him right off, if he had any business to do. The financial reporters used to tell me that they never had to beat about the bush with old Sam Sloan, but would ask their questions and get a straight yes or no from him, no matter what the stock-market exigencies of the other directors might be."
"What inspired you to buy all the D. L. & W. stock you could, and what was your initial reaction when you saw the president's extravagant spending habits?","I bought all the D. L. & W. stock I could because I thought it was a great investment opportunity. After seeing the president throwing away sheets of linen paper with engraved letterheads into the waste-basket, I realized he wasn't extravagant - he was just being economical with resources."
"How did your investment in D. L. & W. stock perform over time, and what dividends did you receive?","My investment in D. L. & W. stock has been incredibly successful. My annual dividends have doubled and quadrupled since I bought the stock, amounting to 236 times my original investment. I still hold onto my shares today."
How did you use your knowledge of a company's financial health to inform your investment decisions?,"I used my understanding of the company's strong economic position, which was reflected in its regular dividend payments and good property, to make informed investment decisions. I bought all the D.L.&W. stock I could, which has since resulted in a significant increase in capital stock value."
What is your current annual dividend income from your investment?,"My annual dividends amount to $236, which is a substantial return on my investment in the D.L.&W. stock."
How do you respond to your friend's claims about your 'hunches' and how you make decisions in the market?,"My friend often ascribes powers to me that defy analysis. I just follow my instincts, which have served me well over the years. The story he tells about the black cat is a bit exaggerated, but it's true that I do get a sense of when to sell or buy stocks."
What motivated you to go to Washington and speak with Congressmen about taxation?,"I was trying to convince them not to tax us too heavily. To be honest, I wasn't paying much attention to the stock market at that time."
"How do you explain your 'irresistible impulses' to trade, and what role do they play in your decision-making process?","I admit that I get these irresistible impulses at times to do certain things in the market. It doesn't matter whether I am long or short of stocks. I must get out. I am uncomfortable until I do. I think that what happens is that I see a lot of warning-signals, and probably that's all there is to 'ticker-sense' that old traders say James R. Keene had so strongly developed."
"What was your experience with the black cat story, and how does it relate to your decision-making process?","The black cat story has nothing to do with my getting up grumpy that morning. I know I wasn't convincing the Congressman I talked to, and the Committee didn't view the problem of taxing Wall Street as I did. My lack of success made me pessimistic over the future of an unfairly taxed business."
"What were your initial thoughts about accumulating stocks, particularly in the Steel trade and copper market, during the beginning of the bull market?","I felt bullish on stocks of both groups and started to accumulate some. I began by buying 5,000 shares of Utah Copper, but stopped when it didn't behave as expected. I also bought United States Steel at almost the same price, accumulating all 20,000 shares."
How did your experience with Utah Copper influence your subsequent stock purchases and decisions during the bull market?,"My holdings of Utah Copper consisted of my initial purchase, but I never got above 5,000 shares. Its behavior didn't encourage me to do more with it."
What was going through your mind when you decided to sell out of your stocks before the end of the bull market?,"I suspect that seeing the high prices made me think of the magnitude of my paper-profit, as well as my line and vain efforts to induce our legislators to deal fairly by Wall Street. This may have been a subconscious realization, but it affected my decision-making."
"When did you start selling out your stocks, and what motivated you to do so?",I sold out when the market proved it for me - I was able to sell my entire line of seventy-two thousand shares of U. S. Steel at a price which averaged just one point from the top of the day and of the movement.
"What was the difference between selling a large quantity of stock versus a smaller amount, in terms of risk management?","When you're selling out, it's no wiser or braver to sell fifty shares than fifty thousand. But fifty shares can be sold in the dullest market without breaking the price, whereas fifty thousand shares of a single stock is a different proposition - and that hurts as much to lose as if you actually had it safe in bank."
"What was your strategy when buying stocks, and how did you determine when to sell?","I began buying both stocks at the same time, and I acted wisely in increasing my line of U. S. Steel from twenty thousand shares to seventy-two thousand, and equally wisely in not increasing my line of Utah Copper."
"When did you start selling out your stocks, and what was the average price you received from selling 72,000 shares of U.S. Steel?","I sold my entire line of 72,000 shares of U.S. Steel at a price that averaged me just one point from the top of the day and of the movement."
"Why didn't you sell out your 5,000 shares of Utah Copper before it broke five points, given your bullish stance on the copper trade?",I was bullish on the copper trade and thought it wouldn't hurt me much even if I didn't make a killing in it. It wasn't based on any hunches.
"How does one become a successful stock trader, according to your experience?","The training of a stock trader is like a medical education. You need to spend long years learning anatomy, physiology, materia medica, and other subjects. Then you observe and classify all sorts of pathological phenomena. You learn to diagnose and do the right thing instantly, thanks to your experience."
"What qualities do you believe are essential for a trader to possess, and how do they contribute to success?","I firmly believe that observation, experience, memory, and mathematics are the key elements a successful trader must depend on. My mathematical ability and power of accurate observation have been invaluable in my career, but it's only when combined with experience and memory that I've truly excelled."
"How does a professional attitude towards trading differ from an amateur or occasional approach, and what role do facts and figures play in Wall Street?","A professional attitude is essential for success. It means keeping up with the latest developments, studying general conditions, and acting almost automatically when necessary. Facts and figures are the foundation of our business – we deal with them constantly, and they're what make us successful."
"How did you develop your understanding of market behavior, and what role does experience play in guiding your investment decisions?",I've learned that the way a market behaves is an excellent guide for an operator to follow. Experience has taught me to trust my instincts and make informed decisions based on facts collected over years of working and thinking.
"What factors influenced your decision to sell 250,000 bushels of wheat at a specific price point, and what did you hope to achieve by doing so?","I sold 250,000 bushels to test the market for timeliness. I was thinking about the strike on coal miners' and railroad shopmen's, which would likely delay the movement of freight and affect wheat prices. I wanted to see how the market would react and whether my hunch was correct."
"When did you decide to sell the first quarter million bushels of wheat, and what pattern did you observe in the buying process?","I sold a quarter of a million bushels on this day when I wanted to test the market for timeliness. The buying was taken in driblets, with lots of 10,000 or 15,000 bushels instead of normal transactions."
"How did you determine that there was no buying power in the market after your initial sale, and what was your next step?","The way the market took my wheat and the disproportionate decline on my selling told me there was no buying power. So I sold a lot more - 2,000,000 bushels - to follow the dictates of experience."
"What role did your years of experience play in guiding your trading decisions, and how did you use observation to profit from variations in market behavior?",My years of experience are my best guides. I observe the behaviour of a certain stock or market pattern to find profitable opportunities. Experience shows me how to profit by variations from the usual.
"How did you approach trading in a bull market, and what was your key consideration?",I never buy a stock even in a bull market if it doesn't act as it ought to act in that kind of market. My experience tells me that it's not wise to buck against the manifest group-tendency.
"What was your strategy for identifying underperforming stocks within a group, and how did you use this information to make trades?","I trade in those stocks which have lagged behind other stocks of the same group. I observe the behavior of a certain stock, and experience shows me how to profit by variations from the usual, that is, from the probable."
"How did you approach trading when you noticed a discrepancy between individual stocks within a group, even during a bull market?","I took notice of one stock in a certain group that was not going with the rest. I was long a fair amount of Blackwood Motors, and when I saw Chester lagging behind, it made people talk."
"When did you first notice that Blackwood Motors was performing differently from the rest of its group, and what made you suspect something fishy was going on?","I noticed it after the general bull movement was well under way. What caught my attention was that Blackwood Motors was rising at a rate of one to three points a day, while all the other motor stocks were following suit. This led me to suspect that something was amiss with Chester Motors, which lagged behind the rest of the group."
What made you decide not to buy Chester Motors despite the general consensus among investors and analysts?,"I decided not to buy Chester Motors because I had experienced the problem of a stock refusing to follow the group leader before. In this case, I figured that if the insiders weren't buying into Chester, why should I? I also noticed that there was actually inside selling going on in Chester, which made me even more cautious."
What evidence did you use to convince yourself that something was wrong with the insider's behavior at Chester Motors?,"I used the tape to my advantage. I noticed that there were no inside buying activities and actually some inside selling going on in Chester. This, combined with its inconsistent market behaviour, convinced me to sell it short."
"What was your approach to identifying potential stocks to buy or sell, and how did you determine whether a stock was worth investing in?","I figured that no matter how prosperous other automobile companies might be, it was a cinch to sell Chester short. I looked out for the warnings, not the breaks. If something must be wrong with a company, I knew it before the break."
"How did you learn about the Guiana Gold Mining Company, and what led you to believe that its stock was overvalued?","I learned about the Guiana Gold Mining Company through the tape. I saw that the stock was being manipulated by a professional market maker who was charging a fee of one third of the profits from the sale of the 250,000 shares above $36. This led me to believe that the stock was overvalued and that there were symptomatic warnings against buying it."
"What was the initial plan to market the Guiana Gold Mining Company stock, and how did it change?","The bankers initially planned to hire a professional to market the 250,000 shares for a fee of one-third of the profits. However, they decided to undertake the marketing themselves at the last minute to save the fee."
"How did you recognize that something was wrong with the Guiana Gold Mining Company stock, and what led you to sell?","I noticed that the stock was behaving similarly to other stocks whose history I knew, such as Chester Motors. The tape indicated that there was something wrong, and insiders were selling their own shares despite being in a bull market. Meanwhile, outsiders were buying because they thought it looked cheap at lower prices."
What was the news that confirmed your earlier suspicions about the Guiana Gold Mining Company stock?,"The news revealed that the company had struck barren rock instead of rich ore, which provided the reason for the earlier inside selling. This confirmation gave me the final push to sell my shares."
"What motivated you to sell Guiana, and what was the outcome of your decision?","I sold Guiana because I noticed that insiders weren't buying it, despite its low price. The lack of insider buying made it a sure thing for me to sell short."
Can you explain why you didn't sell your cotton short when you had the opportunity?,"I was so focused on my stock deal that I neglected my cotton position. When I thought about covering, I'd wait for a reaction and then go back to my stocks, missing the chance to take advantage of the price drop."
"What lesson did you learn from your experience with Guiana, and how does it relate to group-behaviorism?","I learned that understanding group behavior is crucial in trading. In this case, I noticed that insiders weren't buying Guiana because they knew it was overvalued. This lack of insider buying made it a bargain for outsiders like me. If only traders understood and applied these lessons, they'd be much more successful."
"What was your initial decision to cover your cotton short, and how much did you lose?","I covered my cotton short when I realized I had lost $250,000 on the initial deal. I then waited for a reaction, but the price continued to decline."
"Why did you initially decide not to cover your cotton short again, despite seeing no rally in the market?",I was too caught up in my stock deal and didn't want to take my mind off it. I thought about waiting for a reaction and covering when the price would react a little.
"How did your perception of the market change after spending time in Hot Springs, and what was your decision to cover again?","After being in Hot Springs, I realized that my initial assumption about the market's reaction to selling had been incorrect. I decided to cover again because I thought it was no longer a good reason not to."
When did you realize that the turn in the market had come and what prompted your decision to sell?,"I realized that the turn had come when the market took my first ten thousand bales down, which made me certain it was time to sell. The difference in behavior between the initial decline and subsequent price movements convinced me that I was trading correctly."
How did you handle your losses and what led you to cover your shorts after selling your cotton positions?,"I covered my shorts after selling my cotton positions because I realized that the old buying power had given way, and there was no telling at what level it would develop again. I felt confident in my position, so I sold 40,000 bales when I got to New York, which practically made up for my previous loss."
"What drove your impulsive decision to sell the second lot of 10,000 bales while eating lunch, and what convinced you that it was the right time?","It was an impulse driven by conviction that the time to sell cotton had now come. The initial decline after selling the first ten thousand bales showed me that I was trading correctly, so I didn't hesitate to sell again when given the opportunity."
"When did you decide to sell your cotton investment, and what triggered this decision?","I sold my cotton investment after a long-distance call with my brokers, and it was the conviction that the time had come to sell, despite my previous mistake. The line of least resistance had changed from up to down, guiding my decision."
"How did you approach your trading decisions, especially when faced with significant losses?","I didn't hold grudges or hate myself for making mistakes like taking a million dollars out of me. Instead, I focused on covering my losses and moved forward. My trading mind is concerned with solving problems, and I believe I was justified in trying to make up my first loss due to my experience and memory."
"What was the stock that I covered my shorts on, and how did I make money from it?","I used practically the same tactics I told you about covering my shorts at the time Stratton had corn cornered. This time, I covered my shorts on Tropical Trading (TT). I made money both by bulling it and bearing it."
What is special about the way President Mulligan and his friends handle a stock like Tropical Trading?,"The inside coterie has been accused of being more concerned with the fluctuations in the stock than encouraging permanent investment. One broker even said they developed a method to 'milk' the market for that stock, squeezing bears who sell it short."
"How did you decide to go short on Tropical Trading, and what was your reasoning behind it?",I decided to go short when I saw the stock selling at $155 after not seeing a quotation in it for around $140. I thought we were going into a bear market and wanted to bide my time before making the move.
"What do you think is the role of insider manipulation in the Tropical Trading market, and how does it affect traders like yourself?","I believe the insiders' actions, particularly their tendency to run up the price of TT despite the general list being heavy, are abnormal and undesirable factors in trading calculations. It's as if they're milking the market for all they can get, which makes it difficult for traders to make informed decisions."
"What was your experience with Tropical Trading like during that particular time, and how did you feel about being part of a game where insiders often have an advantage?","It was exciting, but also frustrating. I liked the action and the fact that there were no prolonged periods of dullness or waiting for movement. However, I knew I was going up against the insiders who had the loaded dice in their favor."
"What was your initial opinion about the market, and how did you plan to take advantage of it?","I thought we were going into a bear market and I was waiting for the right moment to go short on stocks. However, I didn't want to rush into anything and instead decided to fish and wait for the real call."
"What was your reaction when you read about Tropical Trading's stock price being marked up, and how did it influence your decision?","I thought it was a capital blunder and that nobody can make mistakes of that magnitude with impunity. I believed the insiders in Tropical Trading were trying to manipulate the market, which made me think they would eventually fail."
"What was your strategy after sending off a telegram to sell 2,000 shares of TT, and how did it play out?","I sold 2,000 shares at $153, which was satisfactory. However, I couldn't fish anymore due to being far away from a quotation board. After returning to Palm Beach and seeing the insiders' efforts, I decided to sell another 2,000 shares, which the market declined on my selling."
How did your decision-making process change after realizing you had sold more shares than you thought possible?,"I was happy only when I was selling that stock. After selling 10,000 shares and deciding to return to New York for business, my fishing would have to wait another time."
"When did you return to New York after leaving Palm Beach, and what was the state of your short position?","I returned to New York because I had business to attend to. At that time, I was short 10,000 shares of stock, but I later increased my position to 30,000 shares."
Why did you decide to test the market repeatedly and sell more stock when you discovered that insiders were jacking up the price unjustifiably?,"I sold more stock because I wanted to test the market again and again until I was short 30,000 shares. The strong conviction in my mind strengthened by learning about the company's business and the tone of the general market led me to sell more."
On what points did you decide not to cover your short position despite growing insider pressure?,"I decided not to cover my short position because I believed in my fundamental conditions, which were stronger than ever. The insiders couldn't provide convincing arguments for me to cover, and I had faith in myself and my judgment."
What was your approach to dealing with the manipulation of the price by the insider clique?,"I didn't think the manipulation was particularly dangerous at first, but when the price reached $149, I realized it was wise not to let the Street accept all the bull statements without scrutiny. I stayed patient and focused on my own experience and knowledge."
What did you believe about your own judgment and decision-making process?,"I believed that a speculator must have faith in himself and his judgment, and for me, it was uncomfortable to be wrong unless I was proven wrong. I relied on my experience and knowledge to guide my decisions, rather than relying solely on market trends or the opinions of others."
"What prompted you to sell some shares of Equatorial Commercial Corporation when Tropical Trading touched $149, and what was your goal in doing so?","I sold about 10,000 shares of Equatorial Commercial Corporation because the price of Tropical Trading was synchronized with heavy selling and a sharp break in Equatorial. My goal was to achieve that Tropical Trading's strength was merely a smoke-screen—a manipulated advance designed to facilitate inside liquidation in Equatorial Commercial."
How did you use your experience from the Stratton corner in corn to inform your tactics when dealing with bull rumors and insider manipulation in Tropical Trading?,"I used the same tactics I did at the time of the Stratton corner in corn, such as selling oats to make traders bearish on corn. In this case, I sold shares of Equatorial Commercial Corporation to synchronize the price decline of Tropical Trading with heavy selling and a sharp break in Equatorial."
"When did you start selling Tropical Trading short, and what was your reasoning behind it?",I started selling Tropical Trading short when I realized that we were in a bear market and that the inside clique's bull talk was just smoke-screen. I took advantage of the conviction that we were in a bear market to sell TT short.
"How did you handle the situation when the price of Tropical Trading broke $90, and what triggered your decision to cover?","When Tropical Trading broke $90, I took advantage of the demoralization in the market. The weakness and excess of sellers over buyers were too much for the inside clique to defy, so I covered my position, which was my usual reason for covering – to take advantage of the big market and the opportunity."
What was the conviction that led you to start selling TT short in Florida?,"I had the conviction that we were in a bear market, which started me selling TT short in the fishing-camp in Florida."
Why did you decide to sell Tropical Trading after it broke $90 and the general market was weak?,"Because I couldn't see any support for the stock, but then suddenly, the character of the buying changed, and I realized that the insiders in TT were now buying the stock."
"What was your approach to covering your position in TT, and why did you stick to it?","I stood pat throughout because I knew my position was sound. I wasn't trying to cover at the bottom or buck the trend of the market; instead, I was focusing on turning my paper profits into cash without losing much of the profit."
"What was your initial reaction when you decided to sell Tropical Trading (TT) stocks, and how did you anticipate its price movement?","I initially thought the stock would decline further due to poor business. However, I couldn't see any support for the stock, so I began selling my 10,000 shares. When the price broke on my selling, I realized that something unexpected was happening."
Why did you hold onto TT stocks despite your initial bearish view of the general market and potential paper profits getting away?,"I held onto the stock because I thought the insiders would naturally do what I would have done in their place. However, I should not have made assumptions like that; my job is to stick to the facts and not speculate on what others might do."
What was the trading condition that led you to change your view and go long on TT stocks?,"The price movement told me that the line of least resistance was upward, which changed my perspective. I was initially bearish on the general market, but this specific stock's behavior forced me to adapt."
"What happened to the price of TT stocks, and how did you feel about it?","The price went out of sight above $200, making it a sensation of the year. I was flattered by reports that I had made eight or nine million dollars from selling my shares, but in reality, I held on too long and lost some paper profits."
"What were you when you started working in the stock market, and how did your job as a quotation-board boy help you?",I was just out of grammar school. I got a job as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures. At school I did three years of arithmetic in one. I was particularly good at mental arithmetic. As quotation-board boy I posted the numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"What were your thoughts when you heard that you had supposedly made eight or nine millions of dollars, and what led you to hold onto a certain stock too long?","I was flattered by reports spoken and printed that I had been squeezed out of eight or nine millions of dollars. As a matter of fact, instead of being short I was long of TT all the way up. In fact, I held on a little too long and let some of my paper profits get away. Do you wish to know why I did? Because I thought the TT insiders would naturally do what I would have done had I been in their place."
"When did the price of TT go out of sight, and how much was the price at that point?",The price went out of sight above $200. I held on a little too long and let some of my paper profits get away.
"What is your view on manipulation in the stock market, and how do you think it can be solved?","I don't know when or by whom the word 'manipulation' was first used. In my opinion, rigging the market to facilitate cheap purchases of a stock is also manipulation. It's difficult to avoid doing what some would think illegitimate in order to buy a big block of a stock in a bull market without putting up the price on yourself."
"How did you learn about manipulation and speculation, considering that most of the tricks from the past are obsolete and illegal?","I have to rely on studying the human factors, like how people believe what they want to believe and how they're influenced by their desires or the dollar-cost of average man's carelessness. It's valuable to understand the psychology of speculators, as strategy remains the same despite changing weapons."
When did you first come to New York and what was the initial fuss about in the stock market at that time?,"I first came to New York when I was young. There was a great fuss made about wash sales and matched orders back then, as these practices were forbidden by the Stock Exchange."
"What are your thoughts on the psychology of speculators, and how do you believe it applies to stock speculation?","I think the study of the psychology of speculators is just as valuable today as it was back then. People will continue to make the same mistakes they've made in the past, which means that strategy remains the same on the New York Stock Exchange as it would be on the battlefield."
"What do you believe drives people's appeal to easy money during booms, and how does this relate to speculation?","The appeal in all booms is always to the gambling instinct, which is aroused by cupidity and spurred by a pervasive prosperity. People who look for easy money invariably pay for the privilege of proving conclusively that it cannot be found on this sordid earth."
"How did you view the practices of bucket shops and matched orders in your early days as an operator, and what were some of the problems with these methods?","I have seen firsthand how crude wash sales and matched orders could be used to deceive people. The brokers would say 'the laundry was active' whenever anyone tried to wash up some stock or other, and they'd have 'bucket-shop drives' where a stock would be offered down two or three points just to wipe out the myriad shoe-string traders who were long of the stock in the bucket shops."
"What motivated you and many other big operators in the '60's and '70's to try to work a corner, despite often getting stung with an astonishing frequency?","I used to wonder why corners were so popular among the big operators of a half-century ago. They were men of ability and experience, wide-awake and not prone to childlike trust in the philanthropy of their fellow traders. Yet they used to get stung with an astonishing frequency."
"What is the main difference between a corner that might be the result of manipulation and one that might be due to competitive buying, as in the case of the Northern Pacific corner on May 9, 1901?","A corner might be the result of manipulation or it might be the result of competitive buying. The Stutz corner was expensive to everybody concerned, both in money and prestige, but it was not a deliberately engineered corner."
"How did the financial success of a corner depend upon the marketing of accumulated holdings at higher than cost, and what role did short interest play in this process?","The financial success of a corner depends upon the marketing of the accumulated holdings at higher than cost, and the short interest has to be of some magnitude for that to happen easily."
What motivated some of the big operators in the past to corner stocks?,"For me, it was a combination of vanity and the desire for revenge. I've managed to escape being squeezed more than once not because of any special insight, but because I can generally tell when the character of buying in a stock makes it imprudent for me to be short."
"How did old Daniel Drew use to operate his corners, and who was able to squeeze him out?","Old Daniel Drew would often squeeze boys by selling them stocks they had shorted to him at high prices. He was himself squeezed by Commodore Vanderbilt in Erie, who quoted the famous phrase 'He that sells what isn't his'n, must buy it back or go to pris'n'."
Who was known as the acknowledged king of the Public Board in 1863 and how did he lose all his millions?,"Addison G. Jerome was considered the king of the Public Board in the spring of 1863, but he lost all his millions to Henry Keep, also known as William the Silent, who squeezed him out of his fortune."
"How did you get your start in the stock market, and what was your first job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did you develop your skills as a trader, and what inspired you to adopt certain strategies?","My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately. In fact, I was so good with numbers that I completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school."
What do you think about the trading strategies used by famous traders like Jay Gould and Collis P. Huntington?,"I can see that they had an amazing knack for adapting themselves to new conditions, and that is valuable in a trader. He utilised the stock market of course. But I suspect it was because that was the quickest and easiest way to quick and easy money and he needed many millions."
"How did you perceive the motivations behind short selling, and what were some common practices among professional traders?","Apart from selling by faith-breaking politicians in the Harlem corner of the Commodore, I gather from the stories I have read that the professional traders sold the stock because it was too high. And the reason they thought it was too high was that it never before had sold so high; and that made it too high to buy; and if it was too high to buy it was just right to sell."
What were some common practices among stock manipulators during the early '60s?,"There were scores of minor manipulators, and even big figures like Shylock made a lot of money through clique stocks. I remember Jacob Little's name because he was one of the few men in Wall Street who had made as much or more than me."
"When did you first come to New York, and what was your primary focus there?","I came to New York when I was just a youngster. My main priority at that time was duplicating my success in the bucket shops of my native city, but not specifically focusing on manipulation or working with prominent operators like James R. Keene."
"What did you consider 'thimble-rigging' in relation to manipulation, and how did your experiences in bucket shops influence your view?","I thought of thimble-rigging as a form of trickery or deception. My time in the bucket shops taught me about such tactics, which led me to initially view manipulation as a somewhat unsavory practice."
"Who was James R. Keene, and what notable achievement did he accomplish during his time working with U. S. Steel stocks?","James R. Keene was one of the greatest stock manipulators on Wall Street. During his time with U. S. Steel stocks, he created a remarkable manipulation masterpiece that earned him significant recognition."
"What was your initial experience in the stock market, and how did you get started?",I went to work right after grammar school. I got a job as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures. At school I did three years of arithmetic in one. I was particularly good at mental arithmetic.
"What skills or knowledge do you think are essential for success in the stock market, and how has your experience with bucket shops influenced your views on this?","I don't think there's much meaning to it. If I thought about it at all I suppose I must have regarded it as a well-dressed form of thimble-rigging, of which the lowbrow form was such tricks as had been tried on me in the bucket shops."
How did you capitalize your knowledge and experience to become one of the most successful manipulators in Wall Street?,"He capitalized his knowledge of the game, his experience as an operator and his talents when he sold his services to the Havemeyer brothers, who wanted him to develop a market for the Sugar stocks."
"What was your approach to pool operations, and how did you handle conflicts with other traders or associates?","I am told that in these pool operations he never asked or accepted a fee, but paid for his share like the other members of the pool. The market conduct of the stock, of course, was exclusively in his charge."
"When did you first get involved in the stock market, and what was your initial job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"How did Keene's success in manipulating U.S. Steel shares in 1901 compare to other successful traders, and what made his feat particularly notable?","Keene's manipulation of U.S. Steel shares was incredibly successful, but it's difficult to analyze exactly how he did it since his methods are not publicly available. What is notable about his success is that even top traders like H.H. Rogers and William Rockefeller, who had unlimited resources and experience, couldn't sell their surplus stock without assistance from Keene."
"What were some of the factors that contributed to Keene's success in 1901, including both business conditions and sentiment?","The combination of favorable business conditions, actual demand, sentiment, and my unlimited financial backing made it possible for me to achieve great success. We weren't just in a bull market, but a full-blown boom with a state of mind that wasn't likely to be seen again."
"What was your experience like working as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office, and what skills did you develop during this time?","I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room. I quickly grasped figures and was particularly good at mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in my work."
How did William Keene's strategy during the Amalgamated stock campaign differ from your approach to selling stocks?,"Keene worked as he always did—that is, doing his big selling on the way down after the big rise. He sold it on the way down, whereas I told you that I would sell it on the way up. Keene's tactical moves were directed by his needs and by the minor currents that changed from day to day."
"When did James R. Keene first arrive in New York, and what was his initial financial achievement?",I learned that James R. Keene arrived in New York from California in 1876 and made nine million dollars in two years.
"How did H. H. Rogers give you the friendly tip to buy Amalgamated stock, and what price was it at?",H. H. Rogers gave me a friendly tip to buy Amalgamated stock around $130.
"What qualities made James R. Keene a great stock operator, according to you?","Keene had the qualities of mind associated with successful speculators in superlative degree: he was fearless but never reckless, and could turn around quickly if he found himself wrong."
"What makes a great stock operator like yourself, and how did you achieve success in the early 20th century?","I believe it's because I'm a great manipulator because I was a great stock operator and knew the game of speculation from the ground up. Conditions at the time permitted me to do so, and I would have been just as successful if they were different."
"How does one become a master of manipulation in advertising through the tape, and what principles should guide this process?","To be a great manipulator, you must first understand that manipulation is the art of advertising through the medium of the tape. The tape should tell the story I wish my readers to see - the truer the story, the more convincing it is. And as a trader, I've learned that sound trading principles are essential for effective manipulation."
"How has the landscape of stock trading changed since Jesse Livermore's time, and what are the implications for traders like yourself?","The rewards aren't as great anymore, since it's no longer pioneering work. But in some ways, manipulation is easier; in others, much harder than it was back in Keene's day."
"Can you elaborate on what makes manipulation 'easier' in certain respects, and 'harder' in other ways?","Well, I think the lack of regulation has made some aspects of trading more accessible. But at the same time, the increased complexity and scrutiny have raised the bar for successful traders."
"What do you call the process of selling stocks in bulk, as long as it's not accompanied by misrepresentation?",The selling of a stock in bulk
Who are the people that a manipulator typically turns to when looking for big returns on their capital?,Men who are speculators and willing to run a greater than normal business risk
"What is your opinion on someone who blames others for their own failure to make easy money, especially after losing money?","He's a devil of a clever fellow when he wins, but when he loses money, the other fellow was a crook; a manipulator!"
"How do manipulators typically aim to sell stock, and what's their main goal?","In the majority of cases, the object of manipulation is to sell stock to the public at the best possible price. It's not just about selling, but also about distributing the stock in a way that benefits the market."
Can you give an example of a manipulative tactic used by Jay Gould to gain control of Western Union?,"Jay Gould would buy a big block of Western Union stock and then have someone, like Washington E. Connor, pose as a buyer to create the illusion that Mr. Gould was interested in buying more stock. This allowed them to sell him all the stock he wanted at a high price."
"How do you approach a situation where someone wants to sell their block of stock, and what is your role in the process?","I listen to what they have to say and ask for any necessary information to understand the deal. Then, I determine the value and potential risks involved, and decide whether or not to take on the deal."
You mentioned that stocks are manipulated to the highest point possible before being sold to the public. Can you explain this strategy further?,"Well, it's a matter of knowing when to stop. We push the stock as high as we can, and then sell it to the public when they're most eager to buy. It's not about trying to deceive anyone, but rather about understanding the market and playing on human psychology."
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did you develop your skills as a quotation-board boy?","I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room. My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately."
"How do you approach a client who wants to invest in a stock, and what information do you ask for before making a decision?","I take it that the client seeks one of my professional skills. He tries to find out all he can about me, arranges an interview, and calls at my office. I determine the value and market possibilities of that stock based on his request. My reading of current conditions helps me gauge the likelihood of success for the proposed operation."
"Can you explain your strategy when making a call on a block of stock, and how do you balance your own interests with those of your clients?","I generally ask and receive calls on a block of stock. I insist upon graduated calls as the fairest to all concerned. The price begins at a little below the prevailing market price and goes up. If the result of my professional work is that the manipulation—the price goes up—and there's a good demand for the stock, I call the stock. My clients make money too; this is how it should be if they're paying me to use my skill."
"What was your approach to getting started in the stock market, and what were you initially doing as a quotation-board boy?",I went to work right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
How do you make stocks active and what role do floor traders play in this process?,"I make the stock active by merely making it active, which means creating a free market for it. This attracts activity from the floor traders, who will buy or sell any stock at any level if there is demand. They follow my moves all the way up and are a great help in spreading the word about the stock."
"What is your strategy for making a stock active in order to draw speculators' attention, and how does it benefit you?","I make a stock active by buying it and selling it, which draws the attention of speculators. This allows me to create demand and fill that demand, ultimately benefiting myself as I sell more stock than I actually hold."
"What happens when the public's demand for a stock is high, and how does it affect your strategy?","When the demand from the public or traders is strong, I can sell more stock at higher prices because there are fewer buying orders. This means I can accumulate more stock than necessary, which is beneficial for me."
"What is the purpose of your 'stabilising process', and how does it work?","My stabilising process involves covering stock I sold short at higher prices when demand from the public or traders enables me to do so. This helps support a stock on the way down, preventing reckless short selling and liquidation by frightened holders."
"How do you support a stock without putting yourself at risk, and what's the purpose behind your business?","I always maintain a short position in the stock I'm supporting, which means I'm essentially betting against its price. This way, I can support the stock without risking my own money. My goal is to make a profit for myself, not just put up prices or sell stocks for clients."
"What's your approach when a stock is weak and stagnant, and how do you determine when to buy or sell?","When a stock gets waterlogged – meaning it doesn't go up – that's the time to sell. I look for stocks that have reached their peak price and are now being manipulated down. I follow the line of least resistance, which is the direction of the majority of buyers and sellers. If buying puts the stock up, I stop buying and start selling; otherwise, I'd do the same regardless of whether it's a manipulated or non-manipulated stock."
"How do you determine when to buy and sell a stock, especially when it's manipulated?","I follow the line of least resistance. As long as a stock goes up on my buying, I know I'm all set. If it doesn't go up, I stop buying and then proceed to sell it down. It's not about manipulating the stock at that particular moment; it's about being a stock operator at all times."
"What is your advice when you're trying to manipulate a stock, but it doesn't act as expected?","When my buying doesn't put the stock up, I stop buying and then proceed to sell it down. And that's exactly what I would do with that same stock if I wasn't manipulating it. The key is to know when to quit – don't argue with the tape or try to lure the profit back. Quit while the quitting is good and cheap."
"How did you initially approach selling a stock, and what motivated your actions?",I would sell it down; and that also is exactly what I would do with that same stock if I did not happen to be manipulating it.
"Can you provide an example of how you marked up the price of a stock, and the results that followed?","It was Imperial Steel. The stock had been brought out by reputable people and it had been fairly well tipped as a property of value. About 30 per cent of the capital stock was placed with the general public through various Wall Street houses, but there had been no significant activity in the shares after they were listed."
How did you create a market for Imperial Steel stock when it had been relatively inactive?,"I marked up the price of the stock 30 points, which accumulated only seven thousand shares and developed a market that would absorb almost any amount of stock."
"What was unique about the behavior of Imperial Steel stock, and how did this affect speculators?","The stock never behaved spectacularly, remaining stable in price and dividend permanency. This made it a speculation that could induce investors to buy against their will."
"How did you approach creating a market for Imperial Steel stock, and what information did you gather from experts?",I looked into the property by having experts evaluate its various departments. They provided unbiased reports that helped me understand the facts about the company.
"How did you approach creating a market for Imperial Steel's stock, and what terms did you propose to the syndicate?","I conducted thorough research on the company by having experts review its various departments. I then proposed that the syndicate sell their holdings at better prices than they thought they would obtain in the open market, with me undertaking the job for a contingent fee of calls on one hundred thousand shares of Imperial Steel stock. The price of these calls ranged from $70 to $100 per share."
"What motivated you to enter a stock deal, and how did you prepare for it?","I went into a stock deal with the understanding that my clients would stand to make a fair profit. To prepare, I tied up 70% of the outstanding shares in a trust agreement, protecting myself from the majority holders who controlled most of the stock."
"How did you determine which stocks were likely to experience an advance, and what was your strategy for taking advantage of those advances?","I found out how much stock was likely to come on the market by asking my brokers. I then quietly took all the stock that was for sale at $70 or higher, knowing that a moderate demand would trigger other buying orders and selling orders."
"When you started buying stocks, what were your criteria for selecting which ones to buy?",I bought all the stock that was for sale at $70 and higher. I quietly took all the stock that was available at these prices.
How did you use publicity and media coverage to influence sentiment in the market?,"My job was to seek directly to influence sentiment by the best possible kind of publicity. The tape did all that was needed for my purpose, and I relied on reputable newspapers to print explanations for market movements."
"What role did you play in shaping the demand for Imperial Steel, and how did you profit from it?","I relieved the market of the pressure by selling the stock that I had bought from tired-out holders. My sales were judiciously done, and I filled the demand for Imperial Steel created by the obviousness of the stock's rising tendency."
"When you relieved the market of pressure on Imperial Steel, what was the stock's price at that time?",The stock was for sale at $70 and a little higher
"What happened to your buying power after selling some of your shares to traders, and how did you take advantage of it?","My own buying power was temporarily deprived of the market, but I bought back the stock on the way down a couple of points higher"
"Why do speculators often change their minds about selling their shares when the price trend changes, and how did you take advantage of this?","Speculators vow they will sell out if there is a rally, but they change their minds with the change in the stock's price-trend. I took advantage of this by buying back the stock on the way down"
"What was your first job in the stock market, and how did it relate to your mathematical skills?","I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room. My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately."
"How did you manipulate the market price of Imperial Steel to create confidence among investors, and what was your goal?",I always kept the upward movement within bounds both as to extent and as to speed. In buying on the way down and selling on the way up I was doing more than marking up the price: I was developing the marketability of Imperial Steel. My goal was to create a market where people could buy or sell freely without causing violent fluctuations in the price.
"What was the outcome of your manipulation efforts on Imperial Steel, and how did you benefit from it?","After buying and selling a good many thousands of shares I succeeded in making the stocks sell at par. At one hundred dollars a share everybody wanted to buy Imperial Steel. I accumulated only seven thousand shares, which meant a profit of fifteen points on each share, but my entire profit was much more due to having a market for all I wanted to sell."
"I went to work right after grammar school and had my first job as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. What was my role in that position, and what skills did I utilize?","I posted the numbers on the big board in the customers' room. My quick grasp of figures was a real asset - I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely."
"In my manipulation of Imperial Steel, I accumulated thirty thousand shares and made a profit of fifteen points. How did you use this stock, and what was the outcome for your profits?",I used the stock to secure an offer from a prominent banking house that wanted to control the company. I sold out my options on the hundred thousand shares for an enormous profit.
"What are some of the key trading principles you adhere to, and why is maintaining a dispassionate attitude towards the market important?",I never argue with the tape or lose my temper at the market because of its behavior. This allows me to make sound decisions based on fundamental analysis and basic trading principles.
"How did you approach trading, and what principles guided your decisions?",I never lose sight of basic trading principles. I never argue with the tape or lose my temper at the market because of its behavior. This allows me to stay dispassionate and focused on making informed trades.
"What was your relationship like with John Prentiss, and how did you work together?","I had been friendly with Prentiss for years. He had given me valuable information in the past, and I had shared my expertise with him as well. When he formed a pool to sell his stock, he came to me for help in disposing of their holdings."
"Why did you agree to take charge of Pete Products, and what were your reservations about it?","He came to me with a proposal to manage the market for Pete Products and dispose of the pool's holdings. I declined at first due to my doubts about the stock's viability, but he persisted and I agreed on personal grounds. I also felt compelled to support my friend Prentiss."
"What factors did you believe would hinder your success with Pete Products, and how did you address them?","I was convinced that the market was approaching its end of a bull swing, which made me skeptical about the stock's prospects. However, I decided to work hard and start putting up the price, which gave me some moderate success."
"What challenges did you face while managing the pool's holdings in Pete Products, and how did you ultimately approach your goal?","I had to contend with Prentiss' own mistakes as a manipulator of the stock, but my main concern was time. I feared that the market would turn bearish before I could accomplish much. In the end, I focused on getting out with as little loss as possible to the pool."
"How do you approach selling stock, and what is your strategy when it comes to manipulation?","I believe that a cardinal principle of stock manipulation is to put up a stock in order to sell it. However, I don't sell in bulk on the advance. The big selling is done on the way down from the top. My strategy is to start selling from a certain level and believe that all stocks are going down, including Petroleum Products."
"What was your initial reaction when Prentiss insisted on supporting the stock, and what advice did you offer him?","When Prentiss insisted on supporting his stock, I told him it was bad business. I explained that a cardinal principle of stock manipulation is to put up a stock to sell it, but not to sell in bulk on the advance. The big selling happens on the way down from the top, and he couldn't sell his stock at $125 or $130 without breaking par. Instead, I advised him to start selling from where we were, as all stocks are heading down and Petroleum Products isn't an exception."
Why did you think it was a good idea to buy stock for the insiders' pool by Prentiss' orders when he insisted on supporting his own stock?,"I bought stock for the insiders' pool because I believed that the bear market was already upon us. I had verified my first surmise about the end of the bull market through tests in other stocks as well, and I didn't wait for the bear market to announce its safe arrival before I started selling. It was better for Prentiss to sell his stock now on the pool's selling than to risk breaking par next month by someone else, even if it meant going down with the rest of the market."
"When did the general market decline, and why did Pete Products go with it?","The general market began to decline, and Pete Products went with it because the bear market was over, which I had anticipated based on my experience. I had sold stocks short before the market declined, as I believed the bull market was ending."
"Why did you buy stock for the insiders' pool instead of selling, and what did Prentiss think was your motivation?","I bought stock for the insiders' pool because I believed that the bear market was right on top of us, and my plan to sell the pool's holdings at any price would have resulted in a loss. Prentiss thought I did it because I was short of other stocks, but he didn't understand that my decision to buy was based on my bearish assessment of the situation."
What do you believe is the biggest misconception about manipulation in the stock market?,"I think many people believe that a manipulator can control the market and succeed, but that's not true. It's experience and common sense that matter. The public's state of mind and the general market conditions are what ultimately determine success, not just cleverness or a syndicate of wealthy backers."
"How did you get into manipulation, and what was your attitude towards it at first?","I got into manipulation after my successful Bethlehem Steel trade in 1915. At first, I had a professional Wall Street attitude towards stock-market operations and never sought newspaper publicity, but also wasn't secretive about my activities."
What do you believe sets apart sound manipulation from the over-the-counter sale of stocks and bonds?,Sound manipulation must be based on sound trading principles. The difference between stock market manipulation and the over-the-counter sale of stocks and bonds lies in the character of the clientele - investors looking for safety and permanence versus speculators looking for a quick profit.
"How did you get into the game of manipulation that is, in the marketing of stocks for others?",I got into the game after my Bethlehem Steel trade in 1915 started me on the road to financial recovery. I traded pretty steadily and had very good luck.
"What made you decide to take on the role of a manipulator, and what was your initial motivation?",The stories the newspapers printed about how I had paid back in full the millions I owed did the trick. My plungings and winnings were so magnified by the newspapers that I was talked about in Wall Street.
How did Mr. Keene's reputation as a successful trader affect your decision to become a manipulator?,"Mr. Keene's reputation as a skilful stock operator, a winner of millions on his own hook, made promoters and banking houses apply to him for selling large blocks of securities. I saw an opportunity to fill the gap left by Mr. Keene's retirement."
"When did you start trading actively in the stock market, and what was your role initially?","I started trading right after grammar school. I got a job as quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. As quotation-board boy, I posted numbers on the big board in the customers' room."
"How did you capitalize on the bull market of 1915, and what led to your success?",We ran into a boom after the Allies' purchases mounted into billions. The public bought anything that was adequately touted. Scores of men made millions by capitalizing contracts or promises of contracts. I became successful with the aid of friendly bankers.
"What happens when a stock market boom comes to an end, and what role does the average man play in this process?","When the market gets dull and stays dull for a time, it's enough to make people pessimistic. The public's appetite for stocks drives companies to form during booms, but the average man sees a stock as reaching its peak when it first starts to rise, not realizing that there's always room for more growth."
How do outsiders like yourself make up for missing out on buying at the top of a boom?,"Those who are wise enough to avoid buying at the top make up for it by not taking profits. The big money in booms is always made first by the public on paper, and it remains on paper."
"How do you determine when a stock's price has reached its peak, and what happens next?","When a stock's price suddenly advances to thirty dollars a share, I know that's the top until it rises to fifty. That's absolutely the end of the rise. Then it goes to sixty; to seventy; to seventy-five."
What is your strategy when you've identified the peak and the subsequent price increase?,"I would sell, because I know that's the end of the rise. Once the stock reaches thirty dollars a share and then rises to fifty, sixty, seventy, or seventy-five, it's time for me to cut my losses and move on."
What favour did Jim Barnes ask you to do for him regarding the Consolidated Stove stock?,"Jim wanted me to undertake to market a large block of Consolidated Stove stock on behalf of his firm, which had been the principal promoters of the company. He was insistent that I do so, even though I didn't want to get involved with the stock for various reasons."
What were your initial reservations about getting involved in marketing the Consolidated Stove stock?,"I had various reasons for not wanting to get involved with the stock. However, Jim Barnes' insistence on doing me a personal favour and overcoming my objections ultimately led me to agree to help him with the marketing."
"Who asked you to do a personal favour, and what was the favour he wanted you to do?",It was Jim Barnes who called on me. He wanted me to market a large block of Consolidated Stove stock for his firm.
"What did you learn about the state of the banks and trust companies during the war boom, and how did they contribute to the success of various businesses?","I learned that the banks and trust companies were making enormous profits by lending money to promoters and munition makers. They would offer capital to anyone who had a friend with connections in the Allied commissions, and this led to a flood of gold pouring into the country."
"What was the nature of the business deal that Jim Barnes and his associates were proposing, and how did they plan to sell the new company's stock?",They planned to consolidate three well-known stove companies and sell the stock of the new company to the public. The idea was to capitalize on the months-long buying frenzy for engraved stock certificates.
"What happened to the Gray Stove Company consolidation deal, and why did it fail?","The promoters made a series of mistakes. They underestimated the market's saturation point for new stock issues and tried to duplicate the high returns made by other promoters during the boom. Despite being shrewd men familiar with Wall Street methods, they overestimated the public's buying capacity and expected the bull market to last longer than it did."
"What was the main issue with Jim Barnes' deal, according to you?",The main issue was that he underestimated the market's saturation point for new stock issues and tried to capitalize on unrealistic returns made by other promoters during the boom. He also expected the bull market to last longer than it did.
"When I first got involved in the stock market, what was my initial role, and how did I excel at it?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"What happened when the new stock was offered to the public, and how did it affect the situation?",The result was that when the books were closed it was found that the stock which was offered to the public at fifty dollars a share had been oversubscribed by 25 per cent. The best the promoters should have expected was to succeed in selling the new stock at that price after weeks of work and after putting up the price to $75 or higher.
"What lessons can be learned from how the promoters handled the situation with the new stock, and how do I approach similar situations?","General wisdom is less valuable than specific savvy. The promoters, delighted by the unexpected over-subscription, concluded that the public was ready to pay any price for any quantity of that stock. And they actually were stupid enough to underallot the stock. What they should have done, of course, was to allot the stock in full."
"How do you think the promoters could have handled the situation better, and what would have been the benefits of their approach?","They could have kept the price from sagging, thereby inspiring confidence in the new stock's price stability and in the underwriting syndicate back of it. They should have remembered that their work was not over when they sold the stock offered to the public."
"When did you first realize that your actions as a stock trader could have severe consequences, and what triggered this realization?","I realized the severity of my mistakes when I saw how the public's reaction to our initial offering affected the price of Consolidated Stove. The lack of support from insiders made it difficult for the stock to maintain its value, and ultimately led to a significant decline in price."
What was the outcome of Jim Barnes' decision not to support the stock after it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange?,"The bank loaned them thirty-five dollars a share on one hundred thousand shares, and the public's eagerness to buy the stock at $50 didn't translate to interest at lower prices. The price of Consolidated Stove eventually dropped to $37, which was maintained by Jim Barnes' associates to avoid liquidating their loan."
"How did you approach selling Jim Barnes' shares, and what were your initial thoughts about the task?","I told Jim that I'd look into it and let him know under what conditions I'd undertake the work. To be honest, it seemed like a hopeless task. The general market was neither active nor strong, with occasional rallies where everyone tried to believe the bull swing was about to resume."
What did you discover when analyzing the stock market and Jim Barnes' shares?,"I found that there was too much stock held by too few people - too much for safety and far too much for comfort. Certain entities, like Clifton P. Kane & Co., were carrying large stakes in Consolidated Stove, which made me realize the need to dispose of this block in the open market."
"What was your initial problem with the market, and how did you come up with a plan to address it?",I realized that there was too much stock held by too few people - seventy thousand shares in the hands of just three individuals. I wanted to find a way to make a profit without manufacturing demand.
"How did you propose to work with Clifton P. Kane & Co., Barnes, and Wolff to unload their holdings?","I suggested a reciprocity agreement: they would hold off while I sold the bank's shares, and in return, I'd help them make a market for all of us to unload on. It was a way to avoid causing a panic."
What did you understand about the dynamics of the stock market at that time?,"I knew that the bull movement was nearing its end, and there wasn't going to be an overwhelming demand manufactured by my operations. I also understood that the cream had been squeezed out of the market."
"What kind of agreement did you propose to your partners, and how would they benefit from it?","I proposed a sort of reciprocity agreement. If they helped me passively by holding off while I sold the bank's one hundred thousand shares, I would help them actively by trying to make a market: for all of us to unload on."
"Who were your partners in this agreement, and what made them hesitant to sell their shares?","My partners were Clifton P. Kane, Senator Gordon, and Joshua Wolff. They had inherited or acquired large amounts of Consolidated Stove stock, but they knew that selling even a small portion would cause the market to collapse. Senator Gordon was particularly reluctant because he had no market to unload on, and his old friends and business associates urged him not to sell."
"When did you first hear of Joshua Wolff, and what kind of trader was he known to be?","I had heard of Joshua Wolff as a plunger on the floor. He was one of the most famous traders in New York, known for his ability to bid up stocks or offer them down with few equals."
What advice did you give to the three largest individual holders of Consolidated Stove when they came to discuss forming a syndicate?,"I advised them to form a syndicate, raise six millions in cash, and then give the syndicate a call on their two hundred thousand shares at $40. I suggested putting all their stock in escrow and making some money if everything went well."
How did Joshua Wolff's reputation as a gambler affect his perception among others?,"People used to accuse him of being nothing but a gambler, but he had real ability and a strongly developed aptitude for the speculative game. His indifference to highbrow pursuits made him the hero of numberless anecdotes."
What is the advice you gave to your friends about forming a syndicate to invest in the stock market?,"I suggested they raise six millions in cash, put their shares in escrow, and give me a call on my two hundred thousand shares at $40. This way, if everything went well, they'd make some money and we could all benefit from it."
"Why did you urge the syndicate to act quickly, despite your own experience with slow money coming in?","I urged haste because I knew that in the stock market, things can move fast. But even then, the money came in slowly - it took four or five drips before it all arrived."
How did your mathematical skills benefit you in your early career?,"My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately. In fact, I was so good with numbers that I completed three years of arithmetic in just one year at school."
What was your reaction to the sudden surge in demand for Consolidated Stove on the day it started trading?,"I didn't know what it meant, but it didn't hurt my feelings any to see Consolidated Stove perk up. As a rule, I don't have to ask about any unusual movement in any stock because my friends on the floor, brokers who do business for me, as well as personal friends among the traders, told me that nothing else was talked about in the customers' rooms of the commission houses."
"How did you know when to start selling Consolidated Stove, and what made you think the price would go down after your sale?","I let them have stock carefully until I had got rid of thirty thousand shares. And the advance was not checked! The moment it touched $42, I felt that I was justified in starting to sell the stock, as I knew its value and had gathered some idea of its vendibility from the months of inactivity."
I was justified in starting to sell the stock the bank held as collateral. What was my average price for the entire line of stocks?,"My average on the entire line was $37, but I had gathered some idea of the vendibility from the months of inactivity."
Who tipped off the floor traders that you were going to rush the price up fifteen or twenty points without a reaction?,"It was Joshua Wolff, who was the tipster in chief and also had inside buying information that started the rise of the day before."
What did Governor Flower say was the only way he knew to make a stock go up?,"He said it was to buy it. This was also the floor traders' only way, and the price responded accordingly."
"How did you initially get involved in the stock market, and what was your first job?",I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room.
"What was your approach to selling stock, especially when you were short-selling?","I would manipulate the price up to the highest possible point and then begin my real selling. This way, I could sell what I had engaged to sell without having to put the price up twenty or thirty points in a week."
"What happened when you sold your shares of Jim Barnes' stock, and how did it affect the market?","After selling my one hundred thousand shares, I let the stock alone, and it wasn't long before the price began to sag. Eventually, the entire market was weak, and a disappointed bull tried to sell his Consolidated Stove stock at a low price, which broke below the call price of $40."
When did you first hear about the price of Consolidated Stove dropping and how did Joshua Wolff react?,"I was studying the tape when Joshua Wolff burst in, visibly angry. He demanded to know what was happening to the price of Consolidated Stove, which had dropped to 31-¼. His anger turned to outrage as he realized I wasn't responsible for the decline."
How did Joshua Wolff respond when you told him you hadn't bought any shares in Consolidated Stove?,Joshua Wolff was furious when I explained that I hadn't bought any shares in Consolidated Stove. He accused me of playing a 'game' and seemed incredulous that I had over four million dollars in cash to buy shares but chose not to do so. His anger turned him into almost unintelligible.
What was your response when you were accused of buying a share without using your cash?,"I told him that while I had over four million dollars in cash to buy with, I didn't buy a single share."
How did you respond to the accusation that you bought shares under $40 solely for the purpose of unloading them on others?,"I pointed out that while it was true I held a call at $40 and had four million dollars in cash, I didn't touch the money and the syndicate hadn't lost a cent from my operations."
"How did you feel when Joshua Wolff told you to sell out, and what happened next?","I expected him to tell me to do what he thought was best, but I surprised him by telling him to sell out. He looked at me for a moment, seemed taken aback, and then turned on his heel and walked out of my office. He hasn't been in it since."
"What happened when Senator Gordon and Kane called you, blaming you for their troubles?","Senator Gordon was quite peevish and blamed me for their troubles, but I didn't sell their holdings at a good profit like they thought I should have. They couldn't remember that the stock had been unsalable in bulk when they formed the syndicate, only that I didn't sell out when it was active at $44."
"When you were asked what you would do if you were in their place, what did you say?","If I were in their place, do you know what I'd do? I'd sell out! They looked at me a moment, and without another word turned on their heel and walked out of my office. They're still sore about it."
"What was your approach to selling the stock for the syndicate, and how did you manage to liquidate their holdings?","I took a logical natural way to sell the stock, regardless of price. I sold on the way down and without trying to put up the price first. It worked out as always – bargain hunters bought it in sufficient volume to enable me to liquidate the pool's holdings."
"How did you feel about not being able to sell the stock at a higher price, according to the expectations of Gordon and Wolff?","I didn't feel anything but that getting angry doesn't get a man anywhere. I was able to liquidate the holdings at 25-¼, which is better than they expected. They're still sore about it, but I'm not."
"How did you feel when people complained about your investment decisions, and why do you not give tips to others?","I've got a real grievance against Wolff, who passed around those bull tips that led to me selling the bank's hundred thousand shares. I never give tips because I don't want innocent people to lose money like they did in this case."
"When did you first hear about Air. Livingston putting up Consolidated Stove, and how did it make you feel?","I heard that Mrs. Livingston was going to put up Consolidated Stove at the third or fourth visit with the dressmaker. It made me feel like I had a real grievance against Wolff, as if innocent people might have lost money following a tip of that sort."
Why do you never give any tips yourself?,I think it's because the dressmaker made me realize that there was something unpleasant about giving tips like that. It's not pleasant to think that people might lose money following a tip of that sort.
What made you realize that speculation in stocks wasn't necessarily a bad thing?,"I've come to accept that speculation will never disappear. It's not desirable, but it can't be checked by warnings about its dangers. People will always guess wrong, even with careful plans and experience."
"What kind of practices or abuses in the stock market did you witness when you first started out, and how have they changed over time?","When I first came to Wall Street, I saw many common practices that were morally and commercially indefensible. The old-fashioned bucket shops are gone, but some brokerage houses still engage in questionable practices."
"Why did you feel a sense of grievance against Wolff, as mentioned by Mrs. Livingston's dressmaker?",I felt a grievance against Wolff because the dressmaker made me realize that innocent people may have lost money following a tip from him. I've learned to be cautious and never give out tips myself.
"What inspired you to write about your experiences in the stock market, and what do you hope readers will take away from your story?","I wanted to share my insights and lessons learned with others who are interested in making a profit in the stock market. I believe that my story can serve as a warning to those who would seek to make quick profits by exploiting others, and also offer guidance to those who wish to operate intelligently and successfully."
"You've noticed changes in the way the Stock Exchange operates over time. What specific practices or abuses have you seen improve, and what areas still require improvement?","I'm heartened to see that many of the old-fashioned bucket shops are gone, but I still believe that there's room for improvement. The ingrained conservatism of Wall Street is a major obstacle to change, and we need to do more to enforce strict adherence to rules and regulations."
"What was Jesse Livermore's first job in the stockbrokerage office, and how did he utilize his mathematical skills?","I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room. My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately."
"What are some of the key dangers that stock speculators face, according to Jesse Livermore?","The speculator's deadly enemies are: Ignorance, greed, fear, and hope. Deliberate misinformation is also a significant source of loss, as it can be difficult to distinguish from genuine information. The public often relies on tips or rumours, which can be unreliable, while professional tipsters may use various tactics to deceive them."
What do you believe is the primary problem with anonymous bullish statements in the financial press?,I firmly believe that the public's losses would be greatly reduced if no anonymous statements of a bullish nature were allowed to be printed.
Why do you think these types of statements are misleading and can lead to significant losses for the public?,"The overwhelming majority of the bullish articles printed on the authority of unnamed directors or insiders convey unreliable and misleading impressions to the public, leading them to make uninformed investment decisions."
"Do you think it's possible for a person to be told why a certain stock is going up, and if so, how would that affect your approach to investing?","Naturally, the manipulators 'explain' the advance in a way calculated to facilitate distribution. But I believe it's essential to remember that manipulation of some sort enters into practically all advances in individual stocks, with the primary object being to sell at the best possible profit."
"How did you get your start in the stock market, and what was your first job?",I went to work when I was just out of grammar school. I got a job as quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures.
"What role do you believe insiders play in manipulating the stock market, and how do they achieve their goals?",I firmly believe that advances in individual stocks are engineered by insiders with one object: to sell at the best profit possible. They keep valuable information from the public while quietly buying up cheap stock to drive prices up.
"How do you think the public is misled by anonymous statements in the media, and what impact does this have on individual investors?","I'm convinced that the public loses millions of dollars every year because they accept unreliable and misleading impressions from unnamed directors or insiders. These statements are meant to facilitate distribution, but they convey false confidence to the public."
"When you first start working, what was your role in a stockbrokerage office, and what skills did you bring to it?","I started working right after grammar school. My first job was as a quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was responsible for posting numbers on the big board in the customers' room. My quick grasp of figures was a real asset. I excelled in mental arithmetic, which helped me immensely in posting numbers rapidly and accurately."
"How did insider buying influence the stock price of a company that had supposedly turned a corner, but didn't really have any reason to justify its rise?","The modest director who knew no warrant for the rise in the stock was now quoted by the tickers as saying that the stockholders had every reason to feel greatly encouraged over the outlook. The public began to buy the stock, and these purchases helped put the price even higher. Eventually, the predictions of the unnamed directors came true, and the company resumed dividend payments or increased the rate."
"How did the behavior of insiders affect the market when earnings were good, but not when they weren't?","When earnings were good and the company's business continued to prosper, insiders bought up shares at low prices without hesitation. However, when the trend turned for the worse, they sold quietly, allowing the stock price to decline. This insider selling was a key factor in driving down the stock price."
"What happens when the market starts to decline, and how do insiders respond?","When the market started to decline, insiders usually sold their shares quietly, allowing the stock price to fall further. The public would then be left with exaggerated explanations for the decline, often attributing it to 'bear drives' or other external factors."
How do news-tickers typically report on insider selling and market declines?,"News-tickers would often report that insiders were selling their shares due to a 'bear drive', and that the decline was not a result of any underlying issues with the company. They might even claim to be 'reliably informed' about the motivations behind the insider's actions, which is often just speculation or misinformation."
"What is your experience with the stock market, and how did you get started?",I went to work when I was just out of grammar school. I got a job as quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures. At school I did three years of arithmetic in one. I was particularly good at mental arithmetic.
"How do you think the public reacts to bullish statements from prominent insiders, and what are the consequences for investors?","What is the public to believe after reading the statement of the 'prominent director'? What can the average outsider think? Of course, that the stock should never have gone down; that it was forced down by bear-selling and that as soon as the bears stop, the insiders will engineer a punitive advance during which the shorts will be driven to cover at high prices."
What is your observation about the behavior of stocks when they are being heavily manipulated by insiders?,"The stock in question, notwithstanding all the threats or promises of a tremendous squeeze of the overextended short interest, does not rally. It keeps on going down. It can't help it. There has been too much stock fed to the market from the inside to be digested."
What is your experience with insider selling and its impact on stock prices?,"I've seen firsthand how inside selling can lead to a prolonged decline in stock prices. When everyone sells, but nobody buys, it's a recipe for disaster. The public needs to understand that a protracted decline is usually caused by something going wrong with the company or market, not just bear raiding."
Can you tell me about the classic example of insider selling and its consequences on the New Haven stock?,"The New Haven stock is a prime example. Sold at $255 in 1902, it was considered the premier railroad investment in New England. But when Mr. Morgan took over and implemented new policies, the company's financial situation deteriorated rapidly. A few clear-sighted observers predicted the downfall, but most were too afraid to speak out. The stock price plummeted, and the company eventually went bankrupt."
"What were some of the early warning signs that something was amiss with the New England railroad company, and how did insiders respond?","I noticed that property after property was being saddled in the Consolidated Road at inflated prices. A few clear-sighted observers began to doubt the wisdom of the Mellen policies. Insiders, however, remained optimistic and continued to sell their holdings, even as they sold at higher prices than necessary."
"How did the public react when insiders started selling, and what were some of the accusations leveled against those who questioned the company's fortunes?","The public was accused of being reckless and impugning the strength of Gibraltar by questioning the management's actions. Those who dared to speak out were labeled as stock-jobbers and demagogues. Meanwhile, the price of the stock continued to fall, with new lows set each day."
"What was the actual reason for the historic decline in the value of New England's railroad stock, according to you?","It wasn't a bear drive at all. The insiders sold their holdings right along and always at higher prices than necessary. They knew the stock was overvalued, but they didn't want to admit it. The price kept falling, regardless of what the insiders said or did."
"What do you think led to the stock's deplorable decline, and why did it not follow the typical pattern of bear raids?","I believe the public was misled into thinking that a 'bear drive' was responsible for the stock's decline. In reality, insiders were selling at higher prices than they would have if they had been honest about the stock's true value. It was a case of mass hysteria, where people were afraid to sell because they thought the price would rebound."
How did you feel when you became the 'stock excuse' in place of Keene and others who were blamed for such events?,"It was a bitter pill to swallow, knowing that I had become the scapegoat for the failures of others. But I knew it was only natural - people needed someone to blame, and I just happened to be the one they pointed their fingers at."
What is the difference between the perspective of insiders and outsiders when it comes to buying or selling a stock like Intervale Oil?,"For insiders, who have knowledge about the company's performance, it's wise to sell on the decline. However, for outsiders who paid a high price for the stock, they tend to hold on and wait for the insider pool to exact its revenge."
What is your warning to the public when it comes to market explanations?,I'd advise people to be cautious of explanations that only serve to justify what unnamed insiders want them to believe. It's essential to remember that the public should beware of these 'bear raids' and not overstay a bull market.
When did you start selling short and how did it help you?,"The Intervale pool continued to sell, and I could sell my stock at $12 a share while keeping it above cost. It was wise for insiders like me to sell on the decline."
What advice do you give to brokers when it comes to giving trading advice to their customers?,"Brokers should give their customers trading advice through market letters and word of mouth, but they shouldn't dwell too much on actual conditions. Instead, they should look ahead six to nine months to see if the business outlook will warrant a buy."
"How do brokers make their living, and what advice should they give to their customers?","Brokers make their living out of commissions from the public. However, I've seen them try to induce the public through market letters or by word of mouth to buy the same stocks in which they have received selling orders from insiders or manipulators."
"What happens when an insider contacts a broker and offers to sell shares at a discounted price, and how does this affect the broker's interests?","The broker gets 'pretty easy money' if he has a large following. The insider gives him calls on 5,000 shares at $45 and 5,000 shares every point up for the entire fifty thousand shares, as well as a put on 50,000 shares at the market. This is absolutely safe for the broker because of the put, allowing him to dispose of his entire line at a big profit."
Can you describe a situation where an insider might try to influence the market price of a stock?,"I've seen it happen when an 'insider' calls up the head customers' man of a large brokerage house and says they're going to give them 500 shares of Bantam Shops at $65, but the stock is now quoted at $72. They want these big shots to buy the stock and create a market where they can sell it at high prices later."
What do you think is wrong with the practice of increasing the capital stock by giving away shares in exchange for old ones?,"It's just a way to make the old merchandise more easily vendible. They're changing the color of the stock certificates, but it's all just a game. The public gets swindled out of millions of dollars every year because they don't ask questions and lose sight of the warning signs."
Why do you think the law doesn't punish these practices more often?,"It's because it's all perfectly legal. The law punishes whoever originates or circulates rumors calculated to affect adversely the credit or business of individuals or corporations, but that's not what's happening here. It's just a clever way for these promoters to make money off the public."
How did the public lose millions of dollars annually due to unscrupulous practices in the stock market?,"The public loses millions of dollars annually because they disregard warnings and rumors spread by Wall Street philanthropists, which tend to depress security values. This lack of scrutiny allows scammers to operate without consequences."
Who is responsible for punishing the disseminator of bearish or bullish news items that affect the credit or business of individuals or corporations?,"The law currently punishes those who originate or circulate such rumors, but unfortunately, nobody holds them accountable. The public loses more money buying stocks on anonymous inside advice when they're too high than it does selling out stocks below their value due to bearish advice."
What experience do you believe is necessary to consistently and continuously beat the stock market?,"I firmly believe that no man can consistently and continuously beat the stock market, regardless of his experience or skill level. The possibility of making losing plays is always present in speculation."
"Can individuals make money in individual stocks on certain occasions, even if they cannot beat the overall market?","Yes, I believe that experienced traders can make money in individual stocks from time to time. However, this does not guarantee success or consistency in beating the market."
What advice would you give to those who want to invest in the stock market and avoid misleading 'information'?,"I would advise people to always keep in mind that the public should realize that the truth cannot be told by the few who know. Also, never believe statements attributed to 'insiders' or officials without verifying their authenticity."
What experience have you gained that has led you to conclude that nobody can consistently beat the stock market?,"After years of operating as a stock operator, I've come to realize that no man can consistently and continuously beat the stock market. The possibility of making losing plays is always present, regardless of how experienced a trader is."
What do you believe happens when someone acts on 'inside' tips in the stock market?,Acting on 'inside' tips will break a man more quickly than any other adversity. It's like there's no safety net - it can lead to financial ruin much faster than other challenges.
