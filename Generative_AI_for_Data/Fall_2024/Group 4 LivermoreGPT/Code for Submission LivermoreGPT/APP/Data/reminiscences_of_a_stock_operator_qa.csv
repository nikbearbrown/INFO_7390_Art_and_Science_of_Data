They would essentially become my funding source, under the condition that I trade only through their brokerage.
What was your initial reaction to Williamson’s proposal?	I was surprised by the generous offer, knowing that it was unusual for a firm to offer unlimited credit without requiring a significant margin. However, I also sensed some caution and remained somewhat skeptical, questioning the motives and implications of the arrangement.
Why did Williamson make this offer?	Williamson explained that his firm wished to use my reputation as a trader to help them mask their own large trades, allowing them to sell large positions in various stocks without attracting undue attention.   This arrangement would benefit both parties.

I was able to increase my trading volume significantly and to take advantage of a wide range of market opportunities. My success demonstrated the effectiveness of a large-scale trading approach.

My main concern was that the agreement had the potential to limit my trading independence and that it might compromise my own trading methods. While it had clear short-term benefits, there were also long-term implications to be considered.
What ultimately happened to your trading arrangement with Williamson & Brown?	My association with Williamson and Brown ended when Alvin Marquand, Williamson's brother-in-law, passed away.  The firm started unwinding his positions, which negatively affected my trading opportunities. My collaboration with them ended at that point.
After leaving Williamson & Brown, what was the state of the market?	The market entered a long period of stagnation, with very little opportunity to make money. It was a lean time for traders, and many struggled to survive.
Why did you believe that the market conditions were unfavorable?	The market's stagnation resulted from a combination of factors, including limited trading opportunities, a lack of strong market trends, and overall economic uncertainty. These conditions made it challenging to profit consistently.  It was not a good time to be a trader.
