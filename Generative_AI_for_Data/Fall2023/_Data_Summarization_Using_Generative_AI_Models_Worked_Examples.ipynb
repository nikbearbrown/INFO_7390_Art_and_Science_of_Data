She said she thought we were on the decimal system.\r\n","[IAN] Decimal system?\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Memory - classroom)\r\n","[SUSAN] I'm sorry, Miss Wright.\r\n","[BARBARA] Don't be silly, Susan.

I'd given out thelitmus paper to show cause and effect\r\n","[BARBARA] And she knew the answer before you'd started.\r\n","[IAN] Well, not quite. The answer simply didn't interest her.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes, I can see red turns to blue, MisterChesterton, but that's because we're dealing with two inactivechemicals. They only act in relation to each other.\r\n","[IAN] But that's the whole point of the experiment, Susan.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes, it's a bit obvious, isn't it? Well, I'm not trying to berude, but couldn't we deal with two active chemicals? Then red couldturn blue all by itself and get on with something else? I'm sorry, itwas just an idea.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Totter's Lane)\r\n","[IAN] She means it. These simple experiments arechild's play to her.\r\n","[BARBARA] You know, it's almost got to the point where I deliberatelywant to trip her up.\r\n","[IAN] Yes. Something like that happened the other day. I'd set the classa problem with A, B and C as the three dimensions.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Memory - classroom)\r\n","[SUSAN] It's impossible unless you use D and E.\r\n","[IAN] D and E? Whatever for? Do the problem that's set, Susan.\r\n","[SUSAN] I can't, Mister Chesterton. You can't simply work on three ofthe dimensions.\r\n","[IAN] Three of them? Oh, time being the fourth dimension, I suppose?Then what do you need E for?

I hate to think of her alone in thatplace.\r\n","[IAN] If she is alone. Look, she is fifteen. She might be meeting a boy.Didn't that occur to you?\r\n","[BARBARA] I almost hope she is.\r\n","[IAN] What do you mean?\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, it would be so wonderfully normal.

In here? Are you sure?\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes, we saw her from across the street.\r\n","[DOCTOR] (aside) One of their pupils, not the police, then.\r\n","[IAN] I beg your pardon?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Why were you were spying on her? Who are you?\r\n","[IAN] We heard a young girl's voice call out to you.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Your hearing must be very acute. I didn't hear anything.\r\n","[BARBARA] It came from in here.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You imagined it.\r\n","[BARBARA] I certainly did not imagine it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Young man, is it reasonable to suppose that anybody would beinside a cupboard like that, hmm?\r\n","[IAN] Would it therefore be unreasonable to ask you to let us have alook inside?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I wonder why I've never seen that before. Now isn't thatstrange. Very damp and dirty.\r\n","[BARBARA] Won't you help us? We're two of her teachers from the CoalHill School. We saw her come in and we haven't seen her leave.Naturally, we're worried.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Have to be cleaned. Hmm? Oh, I'm afraid it's none of mybusiness. I suggest you leave here.\r\n","[IAN] Not until we're satisfied that Susan isn't in there. And frankly,I don't understand your attitude.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yours leaves a lot to be desired.\r\n","[IAN] Will you open the door?\r\n","[DOCTOR] There's nothing in there.\r\n","[IAN] Then what are you afraid to show us?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Afraid? Oh, go away.\r\n","[IAN] I think we'd better go and fetch a policeman.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Very well.\r\n","[IAN] And you're coming with us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, am I? I don't think so, young man. No, I don't think so.\r\n","[BARBARA] We can't force him.\r\n","[IAN] But we can't leave him here. Doesn't it seem obvious to you he'sgot her locked up in there? Look at it. There's no door handle. Theremust be a secret lock somewhere.\r\n","[BARBARA] That was Susan's voice.\r\n","[IAN] But of course it was. Susan! Susan! Susan, are you in there? It'sMister Chesterton and Miss Wright, Susan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you think you're being rather high-handed, young man? Youthought you saw a young girl enter the yard. You imagine you heard hervoice. You believe she might be inside there. It's not verysubstantial, is it?\r\n","[BARBARA] But why won't you help us?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I'm not hindering you. If you both want to make fools ofyourselves, I suggest you do what you said you'd do. Go and find apoliceman.\r\n","[IAN] While you nip off quietly in the other direction.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Insulting. There's only one way in and out of this yard. Ishall be here when you get back.

That ridiculous school.

Oh, youwouldn't understand.\r\n","[IAN] But I want to understand.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. By the way, Susan, I managed tofind a replacement for that faulty filament. It's an amateur job, but Ithink it'll serve.\r\n","[IAN] It's an illusion. It must be.\r\n","[DOCTOR] What is he talking about now?\r\n","[SUSAN] What are you doing here?\r\n","[DOCTOR] You don't understand, so you find excuses. Illusions, indeed?You say you can't fit an enormous building into one of your smallersitting rooms.\r\n","[IAN] No.\r\n","[DOCTOR] But you've discovered television, haven't you?\r\n","[IAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Then by showing an enormous building on your television screen,you can do what seemed impossible, couldn't you?\r\n","[IAN] Well, yes, but I still don't know\r\n","[DOCTOR] Not quite clear, is it. I can see by your face that you're notcertain. You don't understand. And I knew you wouldn't. Never mind. Nowthen, which switch was it? No. No, no. Ah yes, that is it. The point isnot whether you understand. What is going to happen to you, hmm?They'll tell everybody about the ship now.\r\n","[IAN] Ship?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, ship. This doesn't roll along on wheels, you know.\r\n","[BARBARA] You mean it moves?\r\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis can go anywhere.\r\n","[BARBARA] Tardis? I don't understand you, Susan.\r\n","[SUSAN] Well, I made up the name Tardis from the initials, Time AndRelative Dimension In Space. I thought you'd both understand when yousaw the different dimensions inside from those outside.\r\n","[IAN] Just let me get this straight. A thing that looks like a policebox, standing in a junkyard, it can move anywhere in time and space?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Quite so.\r\n","[IAN] But that's ridiculous.\r\n","[SUSAN] Why won't they believe us?\r\n","[BARBARA] How can we?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, don't get exasperated, Susan. Remember the RedIndian. When he saw the first steam train, his savage mind thought itan illusion, too.\r\n","[IAN] You're treating us like children.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Am I? The children of my civilisation would be insulted.\r\n","[IAN] Your civilisation?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my civilisation. I tolerate this century, but I don'tenjoy it. Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in thefourth dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off fromour own planet, without friends or protection. But one day we shall getback. Yes, one day. One day.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's true. Every word of it's true. You don't know what you'vedone coming in here. Grandfather, let them go now, please.

Their minds reject things theydon't understand.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No.\r\n","[IAN] He can't keep us here.\r\n","[BARBARA] Susan, listen to me. Can't you see that all this is anillusion? It's a game that you and your grandfather are playing, if youlike, but you can't expect us to believe it.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's not a game!\r\n","[BARBARA] But Susan, it's\r\n","[SUSAN] It's not! Look, I love your school. I loved England in thetwentieth century. The last five months have been the happiest of mylife.\r\n","[BARBARA] But you are one of us.

Put yourself in theirplace. They are bound to make some sort of a complaint to theauthorities, or at the very least talk to their friends.

My creature can make fire comefrom his fingers. I have seen it. But I, Kal, brought him here. Thecreature is mine.\r\n","[ZA] He's just an old man in strange skins. Kal has been with us toolong. It is time he died.\r\n","[HORG] I say there is truth in both of you. Za speaks truth, but firecannot live in men. And Kal speaks the truth that we die without fire.\r\n","[HUR] Will my father listen to a woman? If this old man can make firecome from his fingers, let us see it now.\r\n","[ZA] I say what is to be done here, not old men and women.\r\n","[KAL] Za tries to talk like his father, the firemaker.

All thefire you want.\r\n","[ZA] This is more of your lies. The old man cannot make fire.\r\n","[KAL] There was a tree and the creature came from in it. And the fire,it came out of his fingers.\r\n","[ZA] You want to be strong like Za, son of the great firemaker. You allheard him say that there would be fire. There is no fire. Za does nottell you lies. He does not say, I will do this thing, and then not doit. He does not say, I will make you warm, and then leave you to thedark. He does not say, I will fight away the tiger with fire, and thenlet him come to you in the dark. Do you want a liar for your chief?\r\n","[ALL] No!\r\n","[KAL] Make fire. Make fire.\r\n","[HUR] You are trapped in your own lies, Kal.\r\n","[ZA] Great chief who is afraid of nothing. Oh great Kal, save us fromthe cold. Save us from the tiger.\r\n","[KAL] Make fire. Make fire come from your fingers as I saw you.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I have no matches. I cannot make fire. I cannot make fire!\r\n","[ZA] Let the old man die.

When Orb gives fire back tothe sky, let him look down on them. Then that is when they die, and Orbwill give us fire again. Take them to the Cave of Skulls.\r\n","[SUSAN] No! Grandfather!\r\n","[DOCTOR] All right.\r\n","[ZA] The woman is mine.\r\n","[HORG] My daughter is for the leader of the tribe.\r\n","[ZA] Yes, the woman is mine.\r\n","[HORG] I do not like what has happened.\r\n","[ZA] Old men never like new things to happen.\r\n","[HORG] I was a great leader of many men.\r\n","[ZA] Many men, yes. They all dies when Orb left the sky and the greatcold was on the ground. And Orb will give me fire again. To me. Not toyou. Just as you will give me her.\r\n","[HUR] Za will be a strong leader of many men.

The answer simply didn't interest her.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes, I can see red turns to blue, MisterChesterton, but that's because we're dealing with two inactivechemicals.

Well, I'm not trying to berude, but couldn't we deal with two active chemicals? Then red couldturn blue all by itself and get on with something else?

And when the cold comes, you will all die if you wait for Zato make fire for you. I, Kal, am a true leader. We fought like thetiger and the bear. My strength was too much for him.

The whole tribe mightdescend upon us at any moment.\r\n","[HUR] The tribe is asleep.\r\n","[DOCTOR] And what about the old woman who cut our bonds? You understand?\r\n","[IAN] He's right.

I'd be grateful.\r\n","[BARBARA] Hello.\r\n","[SUSAN] Hello.\r\n","[BARBARA] What are you doing?\r\n","[SUSAN] Just drawing.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, can I see?\r\n","[SUSAN] It's the flower I saw in the jungle.\r\n","[BARBARA] What happened out there?\r\n","[SUSAN] Nothing.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well Ian said you were terrified. Well, something must havefrightened you.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's not that so much. It's just that I'm, I'm fed up no onebelieves me.\r\n","[BARBARA] Believes what?\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I don't know.\r\n","[BARBARA] That there was someone out there and they touched you on theshoulder?\r\n","[SUSAN] There was someone there.\r\n","[BARBARA] But you didn't see who it was?\r\n","[SUSAN] No. It was like that. A light touch on the shoulder. I couldn'thave been mistaken.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, I believe you.\r\n","[SUSAN] But Grandfather says that it's impossible for anyone to live outthere.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Susan, it isn't that he doesn't believe you. It's justthat he finds it difficult to go against his scientific facts.\r\n","[SUSAN] I know.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, look. Why don't you just try and forget it for the moment?\r\n","[SUSAN] For the moment.\r\n","[IAN] What's this one for? I don't know how you make sense of any ofthis.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You're quite right, quite right.\r\n","[IAN] Can you find where we are? Well, Doctor?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hmm? Oh.\r\n","[IAN] I was wondering if perhaps you\r\n","[DOCTOR] My dear boy, these eternal questions of yours. Do I know wherewe are, I suppose?\r\n","[IAN] Now listen, Doctor, I don't want to argue with you. We're fellowtravellers whether we like it or not. But for heaven's sake try and seeit from our point of view. You've uprooted us violently from our ownlives. You\r\n","[DOCTOR] You pushed your way into the ship, young man.\r\n","[IAN] All right, all right, I admit it. A small part of the blame isours.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, small?\r\n","[IAN] But naturally we're anxious. What are we going to do? Can we livehere? What do we eat? There are millions of questions.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A very good idea. I'm hungry.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, what's the matter?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I've suddenly got this terrible headache.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, dear, dear, how irksome for you. Oh, this stuff is verygood. This should cure it. Now, not too much, dear, not too much.\r\n","[SUSAN] No. Oh, Grandfather. I'm sorry I was so silly just now. Here,try this.\r\n","[BARBARA] Thank you. Oh, it's very nice.\r\n","[IAN] Let's hope it does you some good.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, did you want something to eat? What would you like?\r\n","[BARBARA] I'd like some bacon and eggs.\r\n","[IAN] All right, bacon and eggs.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Bacon and eggs.\r\n","[IAN] But\r\n","[SUSAN] This is fully automatic.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, certainly, certainly. J62.\r\n","[SUSAN] (turning dials) J62.\r\n","[DOCTOR] L6.\r\n","[SUSAN] L6.\r\n","[IAN] I hope mine doesn't taste of engine grease.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, now, don't be ridiculous.\r\n","[BARBARA] Shall I get plates and things?\r\n","[SUSAN] No, there's no need to.\r\n","[SUSAN] Eggs and bacon.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Bacon and eggs.\r\n","[IAN] What, this?\r\n","[SUSAN] Go on, try it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well?\r\n","[IAN] Mm. Not bad. What do you think, Barbara?\r\n","[BARBARA] I think it's delicious.\r\n","[IAN] My bacon's a bit salty.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It shouldn't be. It's English.\r\n","[IAN] No, seriously, Doctor, this is remarkable. I mean, one bite and Itaste the bacon, another and I taste the egg. How do you do it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Food has component parts, dear boy. Flavours are rather likeprimary colours, you know, you blend two to achieve a third, a fourth,etc, etc.\r\n","[IAN] Well, I think it's wonderful.\r\n","[SUSAN] How's your headache now?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, it's much better. I don't usually get them at all.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Susan, would you like something to eat?\r\n","[SUSAN] No thanks, I'm not hungry.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, child, that's unusual. I do hope your affects outside theship hasn't affected you too much.\r\n","[SUSAN] No. I think I'll go to bed now, anyway.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Right.\r\n","[SUSAN] Do you want to know where you can sleep, Miss Wright?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, yes.\r\n","[IAN] What's that?\r\n","[DOCTOR] The scanner.\r\n","[SUSAN] There was somebody there.\r\n","[IAN] Nothing. Not a thing.\r\n","[SUSAN] But something must have made that noise.\r\n","[BARBARA] Look, I've had enough of this. Please, can't we get out ofhere?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Ah, but the city. I must see the city.\r\n","[BARBARA] But why?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I will not be questioned. Uninvited passengers. I didn't invitethem to the ship. I shall do what I want to do.\r\n","[IAN] Why endanger the rest of us by staying here?\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, please. Please.\r\n","[BARBARA] Stone trees are all very well, but the next forest I walkthrough I want them all to be made of wood.\r\n","[SUSAN] What's the matter?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know. The power take-up was rising normally and\r\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh don't distract me, please.\r\n","[SUSAN] Shall I trace it on the fault locator, Grandfather?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I think you'd better, child.\r\n","[SUSAN] (checking a printout) K7.\r\n","[DOCTOR] K7? Ah, yes, of course, the fluid link. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, there we are, you see. The end of it's unscrewed itselfand the fluid has run out.\r\n","[IAN] Have you got a spare?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, no, no need for that. This is easily repaired. All we haveto do is refill it.\r\n","[IAN] What liquid do you need?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Mercury.\r\n","[IAN] Mercury. Can I get it for you?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, I'm afraid you can't. We haven't any at all.\r\n","[IAN] What?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No.\r\n","[IAN] Don't you carry a supply?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, it hasn't been necessary. This hasn't happened before.\r\n","[IAN] But you must have some somewhere, surely.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no. We shall have to get some from outside.\r\n","[BARBARA] But where? There isn't anything outside because\r\n","[IAN] Yes. There's the city.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, the city, of course. Of course we're bound to get somemercury there. Yes, we're bound to. Well, I mean, what else can we do,hmm?\r\n","[IAN] It seems we have no alternative. We have to go to the city.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, indeed. At first light, then?\r\n","[IAN] Well, it's light enough and there doesn't seem to be anything outthere. We might as well get started. Oh, and Doctor. Remember we'regoing to this city to find mercury, and once we've found it we'recoming straight back here. Is that clear?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, quite so, quite so.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Forest)\r\n","[IAN] Well, shall I lead?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, by all means.\r\n","[IAN] Look.\r\n","[BARBARA] Don't touch it, it might go off.\r\n","[SUSAN] Be careful.\r\n","[DOCTOR] What is it, Chesterton?\r\n","[IAN] I don't know. Stand back, all of you.\r\n","[IAN] I think it's all right. A metal box. It's a box of glass phials.Look.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Let me see.\r\n","[SUSAN] Then there was somebody here last night. They must have droppedthem. I knew I was right.\r\n","[IAN] Yes. Sorry, Susan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'd like to run a few tests on those. Susan, would youtake these into the ship, please?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Thank you. Oh, and by the way, did you remember the foodsupplies?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. A day's supply for four. That's enough, isn't it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, ample, ample.\r\n","[IAN] I trust we won't be more than a couple of hours. You ready, Susan?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] Come on, then. Off we go.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(City)\r\n","[DOCTOR] Do you mind if I sit down for a minute? I feel a bit exhausted.\r\n","[IAN] You all right?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'm just a bit tired. It was a long journey and my legsare rather weak.\r\n","[BARBARA] Why don't you rest here? Ian and I will look around and see ifwe can\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no, no, I want to look around too. I shall be allright, thank you.\r\n","[IAN] I must say, I don't feel too good myself. Look, why don't we getthis over with quickly. Look for instruments, gauges, anything likethat. Ideally what we want is a laboratory.\r\n","[BARBARA] Ian, look.\r\n","[IAN] Why don't we separate and go different ways and meet back here insay, ten minutes. All right?\r\n","[BARBARA] Fine. I'll go this way. (through the door)\r\n","[DOCTOR] Would you lend me your arm, would you, Susan? Thank you.\r\n","[SUSAN] Let's try this one.

Barbara!We'll give her a couple of minutes more, and then if she's not backwe'll have to go and look for her.\r\n","[IAN] We've waited long enough for her.

Come on.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Wait.\r\n","[IAN] What's the matter?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Listen.\r\n","[SUSAN] I can hear a ticking noise.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Quiet, child. Now listen.\r\n","[IAN] Yes. Over here somewhere.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It's stopped now.\r\n","[SUSAN] Hey, there it is again.\r\n","[IAN] It's coming from in here.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Room)\r\n","[DOCTOR] Measuring equipment.

Very intelligent.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, but how do they use their intelligence? What form does ittake?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, as if that matters. What these instruments tell us is thatwe're in the midst of a very, very advanced civilised society.\r\n","[SUSAN] Here it is. The thing that's ticking. It's over here. It's aGeiger counter.\r\n","[IAN] But look at the needle! It's past the danger point.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, that explains a lot of things, doesn't it. A jungleturned to stone, the barren soil and the fact that we're not feelingwell.\r\n","[IAN] Radiation sickness?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'm afraid so. The atmosphere here is polluted with a veryhigh level of fallout, and we've been walking around in it completelyunprotected.\r\n","[IAN] What? But how do you explain the buildings? They're intact.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A neutron bomb. Yes. It destroys all human tissue, but leavesthe buildings and machinery intact. Yes.\r\n","[IAN] What? But how much radiation, and how badly?\r\n","[DOCTOR] We need, we need drugs to be treated.\r\n","[IAN] But where are we going to find them?\r\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis will have to take us to another time and place wherewe can be cured.\r\n","[IAN] But don't you remember? We can't move the ship until we find themercury for the fluid link!\r\n","[DOCTOR] For the fluid link, yes. Yes, I'm afraid I cheated a little onthat. I was determined to see the city, but everybody wanted to go onand, well, to avoid arguments, in short, there's nothing wrong with thefluid link.\r\n","[SUSAN] What? Grandfather, do you mean to say that you risked leavingthe ship just to see this place?\r\n","[IAN] You fool. You old fool!\r\n","[DOCTOR] Abuse me as much as you like, Chesterton. The point is we needan immediate return to the ship, and I suggest we leave at once.\r\n","[IAN] We're not leaving until we've found Barbara.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Very well. You may stay and search for her if you wish, butSusan and I are going back to the ship. Now, come along, child.\r\n","[IAN] All right, carry on, fine. How far do you think you'll get withoutthis?

Well, that's how they've survived ever since. But they'vealways had to be very, very careful, because the crops have always beenin danger. But, you see, they rely on a great rainfall that onlyhappens about every four or five years. Well, it's two years overduenow, and all their crops are ruined.

If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die. But there is a terrible shame inbeing afraid to live. If none of you agree with my reasons, then let mego with these people, and I will help you elect a new chief.\r\n","[GANATUS] I'll go with you, Alydon.\r\n","[THAL] And I.\r\n","[THAL 2] Let's start at once.\r\n","[ANTODUS] And I.\r\n","[IAN] Thank you.\r\n","[ALYDON] You knew what my decision would be.\r\n","[GANATUS] I could always have destroyed it if you'd decided differently.\r\n","[DOCTOR] If we get this intelligent anticipation, we shall succeed.Let's see this.

The lakes are inhabited by all sorts of strange creatures.\r\n","[IAN] Can we get into the city this way?\r\n","[ALYDON] Over the mountains?\r\n","[IAN] Yes.\r\n","[GANATUS] That means going through that swamp.\r\n","[ALYDON] We can't go through the swamp. It's too dangerous.\r\n","[GANATUS] It is dangerous, yes, but I realised last night when I wastalking to Barbara that it is undefended.\r\n","[ALYDON] Undefended? It's a perfect natural barrier. All thosecreatures, you know that yourself.\r\n","[GANATUS] Yes, I know, but I mean the Daleks won't be on guard there.There's a chance to take them by surprise. Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\r\n","[ALYDON] Yes.

I'd be grateful.\r\n","[BARBARA] Hello.\r\n","[SUSAN] Hello.\r\n","[BARBARA] What are you doing?\r\n","[SUSAN] Just drawing.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, can I see?\r\n","[SUSAN] It's the flower I saw in the jungle.\r\n","[BARBARA] What happened out there?\r\n","[SUSAN] Nothing.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well Ian said you were terrified. Well, something must havefrightened you.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's not that so much. It's just that I'm, I'm fed up no onebelieves me.\r\n","[BARBARA] Believes what?\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I don't know.\r\n","[BARBARA] That there was someone out there and they touched you on theshoulder?\r\n","[SUSAN] There was someone there.\r\n","[BARBARA] But you didn't see who it was?\r\n","[SUSAN] No. It was like that. A light touch on the shoulder. I couldn'thave been mistaken.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, I believe you.\r\n","[SUSAN] But Grandfather says that it's impossible for anyone to live outthere.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Susan, it isn't that he doesn't believe you. It's justthat he finds it difficult to go against his scientific facts.\r\n","[SUSAN] I know.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, look. Why don't you just try and forget it for the moment?\r\n","[SUSAN] For the moment.\r\n","[IAN] What's this one for? I don't know how you make sense of any ofthis.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You're quite right, quite right.\r\n","[IAN] Can you find where we are? Well, Doctor?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hmm? Oh.\r\n","[IAN] I was wondering if perhaps you\r\n","[DOCTOR] My dear boy, these eternal questions of yours. Do I know wherewe are, I suppose?\r\n","[IAN] Now listen, Doctor, I don't want to argue with you. We're fellowtravellers whether we like it or not. But for heaven's sake try and seeit from our point of view. You've uprooted us violently from our ownlives. You\r\n","[DOCTOR] You pushed your way into the ship, young man.\r\n","[IAN] All right, all right, I admit it. A small part of the blame isours.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, small?\r\n","[IAN] But naturally we're anxious. What are we going to do? Can we livehere? What do we eat? There are millions of questions.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A very good idea. I'm hungry.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, what's the matter?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I've suddenly got this terrible headache.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, dear, dear, how irksome for you. Oh, this stuff is verygood. This should cure it. Now, not too much, dear, not too much.\r\n","[SUSAN] No. Oh, Grandfather. I'm sorry I was so silly just now. Here,try this.\r\n","[BARBARA] Thank you. Oh, it's very nice.\r\n","[IAN] Let's hope it does you some good.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, did you want something to eat? What would you like?\r\n","[BARBARA] I'd like some bacon and eggs.\r\n","[IAN] All right, bacon and eggs.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Bacon and eggs.\r\n","[IAN] But\r\n","[SUSAN] This is fully automatic.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, certainly, certainly. J62.\r\n","[SUSAN] (turning dials) J62.\r\n","[DOCTOR] L6.\r\n","[SUSAN] L6.\r\n","[IAN] I hope mine doesn't taste of engine grease.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, now, don't be ridiculous.\r\n","[BARBARA] Shall I get plates and things?\r\n","[SUSAN] No, there's no need to.\r\n","[SUSAN] Eggs and bacon.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Bacon and eggs.\r\n","[IAN] What, this?\r\n","[SUSAN] Go on, try it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well?\r\n","[IAN] Mm. Not bad. What do you think, Barbara?\r\n","[BARBARA] I think it's delicious.\r\n","[IAN] My bacon's a bit salty.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It shouldn't be. It's English.\r\n","[IAN] No, seriously, Doctor, this is remarkable. I mean, one bite and Itaste the bacon, another and I taste the egg. How do you do it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Food has component parts, dear boy. Flavours are rather likeprimary colours, you know, you blend two to achieve a third, a fourth,etc, etc.\r\n","[IAN] Well, I think it's wonderful.\r\n","[SUSAN] How's your headache now?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, it's much better. I don't usually get them at all.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Susan, would you like something to eat?\r\n","[SUSAN] No thanks, I'm not hungry.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, child, that's unusual. I do hope your affects outside theship hasn't affected you too much.\r\n","[SUSAN] No. I think I'll go to bed now, anyway.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Right.\r\n","[SUSAN] Do you want to know where you can sleep, Miss Wright?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, yes.\r\n","[IAN] What's that?\r\n","[DOCTOR] The scanner.\r\n","[SUSAN] There was somebody there.\r\n","[IAN] Nothing. Not a thing.\r\n","[SUSAN] But something must have made that noise.\r\n","[BARBARA] Look, I've had enough of this. Please, can't we get out ofhere?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Ah, but the city. I must see the city.\r\n","[BARBARA] But why?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I will not be questioned. Uninvited passengers. I didn't invitethem to the ship. I shall do what I want to do.\r\n","[IAN] Why endanger the rest of us by staying here?\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, please. Please.\r\n","[BARBARA] Stone trees are all very well, but the next forest I walkthrough I want them all to be made of wood.\r\n","[SUSAN] What's the matter?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know. The power take-up was rising normally and\r\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh don't distract me, please.\r\n","[SUSAN] Shall I trace it on the fault locator, Grandfather?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I think you'd better, child.\r\n","[SUSAN] (checking a printout) K7.\r\n","[DOCTOR] K7? Ah, yes, of course, the fluid link. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, there we are, you see. The end of it's unscrewed itselfand the fluid has run out.\r\n","[IAN] Have you got a spare?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, no, no need for that. This is easily repaired. All we haveto do is refill it.\r\n","[IAN] What liquid do you need?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Mercury.\r\n","[IAN] Mercury. Can I get it for you?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, I'm afraid you can't. We haven't any at all.\r\n","[IAN] What?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No.\r\n","[IAN] Don't you carry a supply?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, it hasn't been necessary. This hasn't happened before.\r\n","[IAN] But you must have some somewhere, surely.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no. We shall have to get some from outside.\r\n","[BARBARA] But where? There isn't anything outside because\r\n","[IAN] Yes. There's the city.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, the city, of course. Of course we're bound to get somemercury there. Yes, we're bound to. Well, I mean, what else can we do,hmm?\r\n","[IAN] It seems we have no alternative. We have to go to the city.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, indeed. At first light, then?\r\n","[IAN] Well, it's light enough and there doesn't seem to be anything outthere. We might as well get started. Oh, and Doctor. Remember we'regoing to this city to find mercury, and once we've found it we'recoming straight back here. Is that clear?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, quite so, quite so.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Forest)\r\n","[IAN] Well, shall I lead?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, by all means.\r\n","[IAN] Look.\r\n","[BARBARA] Don't touch it, it might go off.\r\n","[SUSAN] Be careful.\r\n","[DOCTOR] What is it, Chesterton?\r\n","[IAN] I don't know. Stand back, all of you.\r\n","[IAN] I think it's all right. A metal box. It's a box of glass phials.Look.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Let me see.\r\n","[SUSAN] Then there was somebody here last night. They must have droppedthem. I knew I was right.\r\n","[IAN] Yes. Sorry, Susan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'd like to run a few tests on those. Susan, would youtake these into the ship, please?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Thank you. Oh, and by the way, did you remember the foodsupplies?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. A day's supply for four. That's enough, isn't it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, ample, ample.\r\n","[IAN] I trust we won't be more than a couple of hours. You ready, Susan?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] Come on, then. Off we go.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(City)\r\n","[DOCTOR] Do you mind if I sit down for a minute? I feel a bit exhausted.\r\n","[IAN] You all right?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'm just a bit tired. It was a long journey and my legsare rather weak.\r\n","[BARBARA] Why don't you rest here? Ian and I will look around and see ifwe can\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no, no, I want to look around too. I shall be allright, thank you.\r\n","[IAN] I must say, I don't feel too good myself. Look, why don't we getthis over with quickly. Look for instruments, gauges, anything likethat. Ideally what we want is a laboratory.\r\n","[BARBARA] Ian, look.\r\n","[IAN] Why don't we separate and go different ways and meet back here insay, ten minutes. All right?\r\n","[BARBARA] Fine. I'll go this way. (through the door)\r\n","[DOCTOR] Would you lend me your arm, would you, Susan? Thank you.\r\n","[SUSAN] Let's try this one.

Barbara!We'll give her a couple of minutes more, and then if she's not backwe'll have to go and look for her.\r\n","[IAN] We've waited long enough for her.

Come on.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Wait.\r\n","[IAN] What's the matter?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Listen.\r\n","[SUSAN] I can hear a ticking noise.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Quiet, child. Now listen.\r\n","[IAN] Yes. Over here somewhere.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It's stopped now.\r\n","[SUSAN] Hey, there it is again.\r\n","[IAN] It's coming from in here.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Room)\r\n","[DOCTOR] Measuring equipment.

Very intelligent.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, but how do they use their intelligence? What form does ittake?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, as if that matters. What these instruments tell us is thatwe're in the midst of a very, very advanced civilised society.\r\n","[SUSAN] Here it is. The thing that's ticking. It's over here. It's aGeiger counter.\r\n","[IAN] But look at the needle! It's past the danger point.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, that explains a lot of things, doesn't it. A jungleturned to stone, the barren soil and the fact that we're not feelingwell.\r\n","[IAN] Radiation sickness?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'm afraid so. The atmosphere here is polluted with a veryhigh level of fallout, and we've been walking around in it completelyunprotected.\r\n","[IAN] What? But how do you explain the buildings? They're intact.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A neutron bomb. Yes. It destroys all human tissue, but leavesthe buildings and machinery intact. Yes.\r\n","[IAN] What? But how much radiation, and how badly?\r\n","[DOCTOR] We need, we need drugs to be treated.\r\n","[IAN] But where are we going to find them?\r\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis will have to take us to another time and place wherewe can be cured.\r\n","[IAN] But don't you remember? We can't move the ship until we find themercury for the fluid link!\r\n","[DOCTOR] For the fluid link, yes. Yes, I'm afraid I cheated a little onthat. I was determined to see the city, but everybody wanted to go onand, well, to avoid arguments, in short, there's nothing wrong with thefluid link.\r\n","[SUSAN] What? Grandfather, do you mean to say that you risked leavingthe ship just to see this place?\r\n","[IAN] You fool. You old fool!\r\n","[DOCTOR] Abuse me as much as you like, Chesterton. The point is we needan immediate return to the ship, and I suggest we leave at once.\r\n","[IAN] We're not leaving until we've found Barbara.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Very well. You may stay and search for her if you wish, butSusan and I are going back to the ship. Now, come along, child.\r\n","[IAN] All right, carry on, fine. How far do you think you'll get withoutthis?

Well, that's how they've survived ever since. But they'vealways had to be very, very careful, because the crops have always beenin danger. But, you see, they rely on a great rainfall that onlyhappens about every four or five years. Well, it's two years overduenow, and all their crops are ruined.

If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die. But there is a terrible shame inbeing afraid to live. If none of you agree with my reasons, then let mego with these people, and I will help you elect a new chief.\r\n","[GANATUS] I'll go with you, Alydon.\r\n","[THAL] And I.\r\n","[THAL 2] Let's start at once.\r\n","[ANTODUS] And I.\r\n","[IAN] Thank you.\r\n","[ALYDON] You knew what my decision would be.\r\n","[GANATUS] I could always have destroyed it if you'd decided differently.\r\n","[DOCTOR] If we get this intelligent anticipation, we shall succeed.Let's see this.

The lakes are inhabited by all sorts of strange creatures.\r\n","[IAN] Can we get into the city this way?\r\n","[ALYDON] Over the mountains?\r\n","[IAN] Yes.\r\n","[GANATUS] That means going through that swamp.\r\n","[ALYDON] We can't go through the swamp. It's too dangerous.\r\n","[GANATUS] It is dangerous, yes, but I realised last night when I wastalking to Barbara that it is undefended.\r\n","[ALYDON] Undefended? It's a perfect natural barrier. All thosecreatures, you know that yourself.\r\n","[GANATUS] Yes, I know, but I mean the Daleks won't be on guard there.There's a chance to take them by surprise. Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\r\n","[ALYDON] Yes.

It's silly, isn't it?I feel frightened. As if we're about to interfere in something that isbest left alone.\r\n","[IAN] Come on, let's get it over with.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, don't you feel it?\r\n","[IAN] I take things as they come.

Susan. Mister Chesterton and Miss Wright. Shecan't have got out without us seeing her.\r\n","[BARBARA] Ian, look at this.\r\n","[IAN] It's a police box! What on earth's it doing here? These things areusually on the street. Feel it. Feel it. Do you feel it?\r\n","[BARBARA] It's a faint vibration.\r\n","[IAN] It's alive!\r\n","[IAN] It's not connected to anything, unless it's through the floor.\r\n","[BARBARA] Look, I've had enough. Let's go and find a policeman.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, all right.\r\n","[BARBARA] Is that her?\r\n","[IAN] That's not her.

In here? Are you sure?\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes, we saw her from across the street.\r\n","[DOCTOR] (aside) One of their pupils, not the police, then.\r\n","[IAN] I beg your pardon?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Why were you were spying on her? Who are you?\r\n","[IAN] We heard a young girl's voice call out to you.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Your hearing must be very acute. I didn't hear anything.\r\n","[BARBARA] It came from in here.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You imagined it.\r\n","[BARBARA] I certainly did not imagine it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Young man, is it reasonable to suppose that anybody would beinside a cupboard like that, hmm?\r\n","[IAN] Would it therefore be unreasonable to ask you to let us have alook inside?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I wonder why I've never seen that before. Now isn't thatstrange. Very damp and dirty.\r\n","[BARBARA] Won't you help us? We're two of her teachers from the CoalHill School. We saw her come in and we haven't seen her leave.Naturally, we're worried.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Have to be cleaned. Hmm? Oh, I'm afraid it's none of mybusiness. I suggest you leave here.\r\n","[IAN] Not until we're satisfied that Susan isn't in there. And frankly,I don't understand your attitude.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yours leaves a lot to be desired.\r\n","[IAN] Will you open the door?\r\n","[DOCTOR] There's nothing in there.\r\n","[IAN] Then what are you afraid to show us?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Afraid? Oh, go away.\r\n","[IAN] I think we'd better go and fetch a policeman.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Very well.\r\n","[IAN] And you're coming with us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, am I? I don't think so, young man. No, I don't think so.\r\n","[BARBARA] We can't force him.\r\n","[IAN] But we can't leave him here. Doesn't it seem obvious to you he'sgot her locked up in there? Look at it. There's no door handle. Theremust be a secret lock somewhere.\r\n","[BARBARA] That was Susan's voice.\r\n","[IAN] But of course it was. Susan! Susan! Susan, are you in there? It'sMister Chesterton and Miss Wright, Susan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you think you're being rather high-handed, young man? Youthought you saw a young girl enter the yard. You imagine you heard hervoice. You believe she might be inside there. It's not verysubstantial, is it?\r\n","[BARBARA] But why won't you help us?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I'm not hindering you. If you both want to make fools ofyourselves, I suggest you do what you said you'd do. Go and find apoliceman.\r\n","[IAN] While you nip off quietly in the other direction.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Insulting. There's only one way in and out of this yard. Ishall be here when you get back. I want to see your faces when you tryto explain away your behaviour to a policeman.\r\n","[IAN] Nevertheless, we're going to find one. Come on, Barbara.\r\n","[SUSAN [OC]] What are you doing out there?\r\n","[IAN] She is in there!\r\n","[DOCTOR] Close the door!\r\n","[IAN] Barbara!\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Tardis)\r\n","[DOCTOR] Close the door, Susan. I believe these people are known to you.\r\n","[SUSAN] They're two of my schoolteachers. What are you doing here?\r\n","[BARBARA] Where are we?\r\n","[DOCTOR] They must have followed you. That ridiculous school. I knewsomething like this would happen if we stayed in one place too long.\r\n","[SUSAN] But why should they follow me?\r\n","[BARBARA] Is this really where you live, Susan?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] And what's wrong with it?\r\n","[IAN] But it was just a telephone box.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Perhaps.\r\n","[BARBARA] And this is your grandfather?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[BARBARA] But why didn't you tell us that?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't discuss my private life with strangers.\r\n","[IAN] But it was a police telephone box. I walked all around it.Barbara, you saw me.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You don't deserve any explanations. You pushed your way in hereuninvited and unwelcome.\r\n","[BARBARA] I think we ought to leave.\r\n","[IAN] No, just a minute. I know this is absurd, but I feel\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh dear, dear, dear dear. This is very\r\n","[IAN] I walked all round it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It's stopped again, you know, and I've tried hmm? Oh, youwouldn't understand.\r\n","[IAN] But I want to understand.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. By the way, Susan, I managed tofind a replacement for that faulty filament. It's an amateur job, but Ithink it'll serve.\r\n","[IAN] It's an illusion. It must be.\r\n","[DOCTOR] What is he talking about now?\r\n","[SUSAN] What are you doing here?\r\n","[DOCTOR] You don't understand, so you find excuses. Illusions, indeed?You say you can't fit an enormous building into one of your smallersitting rooms.\r\n","[IAN] No.\r\n","[DOCTOR] But you've discovered television, haven't you?\r\n","[IAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Then by showing an enormous building on your television screen,you can do what seemed impossible, couldn't you?\r\n","[IAN] Well, yes, but I still don't know\r\n","[DOCTOR] Not quite clear, is it. I can see by your face that you're notcertain. You don't understand. And I knew you wouldn't. Never mind. Nowthen, which switch was it? No. No, no. Ah yes, that is it. The point isnot whether you understand. What is going to happen to you, hmm?They'll tell everybody about the ship now.\r\n","[IAN] Ship?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, ship. This doesn't roll along on wheels, you know.\r\n","[BARBARA] You mean it moves?\r\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis can go anywhere.\r\n","[BARBARA] Tardis? I don't understand you, Susan.\r\n","[SUSAN] Well, I made up the name Tardis from the initials, Time AndRelative Dimension In Space. I thought you'd both understand when yousaw the different dimensions inside from those outside.\r\n","[IAN] Just let me get this straight. A thing that looks like a policebox, standing in a junkyard, it can move anywhere in time and space?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Quite so.\r\n","[IAN] But that's ridiculous.\r\n","[SUSAN] Why won't they believe us?\r\n","[BARBARA] How can we?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, don't get exasperated, Susan. Remember the RedIndian. When he saw the first steam train, his savage mind thought itan illusion, too.\r\n","[IAN] You're treating us like children.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Am I? The children of my civilisation would be insulted.\r\n","[IAN] Your civilisation?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my civilisation. I tolerate this century, but I don'tenjoy it. Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in thefourth dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off fromour own planet, without friends or protection. But one day we shall getback. Yes, one day. One day.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's true. Every word of it's true. You don't know what you'vedone coming in here. Grandfather, let them go now, please. Look, ifthey don't understand, they can't, they can't hurt us at all. Iunderstand these people better than you. Their minds reject things theydon't understand.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No.\r\n","[IAN] He can't keep us here.\r\n","[BARBARA] Susan, listen to me. Can't you see that all this is anillusion? It's a game that you and your grandfather are playing, if youlike, but you can't expect us to believe it.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's not a game!\r\n","[BARBARA] But Susan, it's\r\n","[SUSAN] It's not! Look, I love your school. I loved England in thetwentieth century. The last five months have been the happiest of mylife.\r\n","[BARBARA] But you are one of us. You look like us, you sound like us.\r\n","[SUSAN] I was born in another time, another world.\r\n","[IAN] Now look here, Susan, you. Oh, come on, Barbara, let's get out ofhere.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's no use, you can't get out. He won't let you go.\r\n","[IAN] He closed the doors from over there. I saw him. Now, which is it?Which is it? Which control operates the door?\r\n","[DOCTOR] You still think it's all an illusion?\r\n","[IAN] I know that free movement time and space is a scientific dream Idon't expect to find solved in a junkyard.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Your arrogance is nearly as great as your ignorance.\r\n","[IAN] Will you open the door? Open the door! Susan, will you help us?\r\n","[SUSAN] I mustn't.\r\n","[IAN] Very well, then. I'll have to risk it myself.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I can't stop you.\r\n","[SUSAN] Don't touch it!

Put yourself in theirplace. They are bound to make some sort of a complaint to theauthorities, or at the very least talk to their friends. If I do letthem go, Susan, you realise of course we must go, too.\r\n","[SUSAN] No, Grandfather, we've had all this out before.\r\n","[DOCTOR] There's no alternative, child.\r\n","[SUSAN] I want to stay! But they're both kind people. Why won't youtrust them? All you've got to do is ask them to promise to keep oursecret\r\n","[DOCTOR] It's out of the question.\r\n","[SUSAN] I won't go, Grandfather. I won't leave the twentieth century.I'd rather leave the Tardis and you.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now you're being sentimental and childish.\r\n","[SUSAN] No, I mean it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Very well. Then you must go with them. I'll open the door.\r\n","[BARBARA] Are you coming, Susan?\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, no, Grandfather!

The meat on it is good. They havebrought you fruit and water has been put into a stone. Is this thestone? Has anyone hurt you?\r\n","[DOCTOR] When are you going to let us go, hmm?\r\n","[ZA] You will stay here. I have the meat and I have the stick, and apiece of skin. I can make fire now.

It's almost alive.\r\n","[IAN] Not alive, Susan. Almost dead. We're going to make four torches.We'll find the sticks. And we'll use the fat from the meat. And then\r\n","[SUSAN] And then?\r\n","[IAN] And then, to all intents and purposes, we're going to die.\r\n","[IAN] When I give the sign.\r\n","[SUSAN] What are they?\r\n","[ZA] Look.

Nothing on Earth could looklike this.\r\n","[BARBARA] It looks like some sculptor's nightmare.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it's certainly alien to anything on your planet. Butyou're wrong about one thing, Chesterfield. This isn't like everythingelse. The animal is solidified, certainly, but it's not crumbly stone.It's metal. Yes, it always was.\r\n","[IAN] What, even when it was alive? But that's impossible.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Why? Can't you imagine an animal unless it's flesh, blood andbone, hmm? No, I tell you this is an entirely different formation. Ishould say originally it was some pliable metal held together by amagnetic field, or an inner magnetic field, rather, and it may have hadthe ability to attract it's victims towards it, if they were metal too.\r\n","[BARBARA] We're not on Earth, then.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, certainly not.\r\n","[IAN] Are you sure?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, certain.

Where is he?\r\n","[SUSAN] Just over there.\r\n","[BARBARA] Susan. Don't you have anything in the ship that records thejourneys?\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, yes. There's a meter fixed to a great big bank of computers.If you feed it with the right sort of information, it can take over thecontrols of the ship and deliver you to any place you want to go.\r\n","[BARBARA] Then why don't we know where we are?\r\n","[SUSAN] Well, it's a question of the right information, you see. I don'tsay that Grandfather doesn't know how to work the ship, but he's soforgetful, and then he will go off and. Well, he likes to work on hisown.\r\n","[BARBARA] So I've noticed.\r\n","[SUSAN] Anyway, he's only got to do some computations back in the shipand we can move on.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, it can't be too soon for me.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well now, are we ready?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Doctor, have you worked out yet how all this happened?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, not really, not really.

We really must get back to\r\n","[DOCTOR] Most fascinating.\r\n","[BARBARA] A city, a huge city.\r\n","[IAN] Well, Doctor? Can you see anything? Any sign of life?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no sign of life. No, just buildings. Magnificentbuildings, I\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, let me have a look. It's fabulous. Here, you have a look.\r\n","[IAN] What do you think, Doctor?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, I don't know. Whatever it was destroyed thevegetation here certainly hasn't damaged the city. But there's no signof life. No movement, no light, no. No, I shall know more about it whenI've been down there.\r\n","[BARBARA] Down there? Oh, no. We're going back to the ship.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, don't be ridiculous. That city down there is a magnificentsubject for study, and I don't intend to leave here until I'vethoroughly investigated it.\r\n","[IAN] Well it's too late to talk about it now. It's getting dark. We'lldiscuss it when we get back to the ship.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Whatever you decide, it's too late to get down there now.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, all right then. But I assure you I'm determinedto study that place.\r\n","[IAN] You can do what you like, as long as you don't endanger the restof us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Very well then. I shall look at it myself, alone.\r\n","[IAN] You're the only one who can operate the ship. I'm afraid I can'tlet you do that, Doctor.

I'd be grateful.\r\n","[BARBARA] Hello.\r\n","[SUSAN] Hello.\r\n","[BARBARA] What are you doing?\r\n","[SUSAN] Just drawing.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, can I see?\r\n","[SUSAN] It's the flower I saw in the jungle.\r\n","[BARBARA] What happened out there?\r\n","[SUSAN] Nothing.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well Ian said you were terrified.

Why don't you just try and forget it for the moment?\r\n","[SUSAN] For the moment.\r\n","[IAN] What's this one for? I don't know how you make sense of any ofthis.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You're quite right, quite right.\r\n","[IAN] Can you find where we are? Well, Doctor?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hmm? Oh.\r\n","[IAN] I was wondering if perhaps you\r\n","[DOCTOR] My dear boy, these eternal questions of yours. Do I know wherewe are, I suppose?\r\n","[IAN] Now listen, Doctor, I don't want to argue with you. We're fellowtravellers whether we like it or not.

Oh, it's very nice.\r\n","[IAN] Let's hope it does you some good.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, did you want something to eat?

Not bad. What do you think, Barbara?\r\n","[BARBARA] I think it's delicious.\r\n","[IAN] My bacon's a bit salty.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It shouldn't be. It's English.\r\n","[IAN] No, seriously, Doctor, this is remarkable. I mean, one bite and Itaste the bacon, another and I taste the egg. How do you do it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Food has component parts, dear boy.

At first light, then?\r\n","[IAN] Well, it's light enough and there doesn't seem to be anything outthere. We might as well get started. Oh, and Doctor.

We must all pretend to be dead. Thenwhen they come in to investigate, we must rush down the corridor\r\n","[IAN] Yes, and then what? No. We must find a way of putting thesemachines out of action.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Remember what they did to your legs.\r\n","[IAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] The floors are metal.

That's an idea.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well how is that going to help us?\r\n","[IAN] Well, if metal is essential\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no, now listen. Let's concentrate on the Daleks.

Dodgems.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It's electricity. I think they're powered that way.\r\n","[IAN] Yes. But just a minute. They have no pick-up or anything. And onlythe base of the machine touches the floor. How do they complete thecircuit?\r\n","[SUSAN] Batteries?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no. I believe the Daleks have discovered a way to exploitstatic electricity. Very ingenious, if I'm right.\r\n","[BARBARA] What, drawing power from the floor?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. If I'm right, of course. Now, what do we know apartfrom guessing how they are powered?\r\n","[SUSAN] Well, they can see all round them.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.

We've lived for so longa time.\r\n","[TEMMOSUS] Perhaps we have lived too long. I've never struggled againstthe inevitable. It's a vain occupation.

If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die.

All thosecreatures, you know that yourself.\r\n","[GANATUS] Yes, I know, but I mean the Daleks won't be on guard there.There's a chance to take them by surprise. Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\r\n","[ALYDON] Yes.

It's going away now. That's better. Icouldn't think where I was\r\n","[BARBARA] Do you want to sit down?\r\n","[SUSAN] No, it's all right.

Oughtn't we to go and help him?\r\n","[BARBARA] I don't like the look of this cut at all.\r\n","[SUSAN] Water. What happened?\r\n","[BARBARA] I don't know. Well, go on.\r\n","[IAN] You're working late tonight, Miss Wright. Can I have a glass ofwater?\r\n","[BARBARA] Susan's fetching some.\r\n","[IAN] Susan Foreman, you mean?\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] What's he doing there?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, he's cut his head. Are you feeling all right?\r\n","[IAN] Dizzy. Shouldn't we help him? His heart seems all right, and hisbreathing's quite regular. I don't think that cut's as deep as youthink.\r\n","[BARBARA] What do we do if his skull's fractured?\r\n","[IAN] I don't think it's as bad as that.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I can't take you back, Susan. I can't.\r\n","[IAN] He's rambling.\r\n","[BARBARA] The ship! The Tardis!\r\n","[IAN] What?\r\n","[SUSAN] Empty?\r\n","[SUSAN] That's funny.\r\n","[SUSAN] The doors! Well, they can't open on their own. They can't!\r\n","[IAN] Perhaps he did it.\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather?\r\n","[IAN] Did it before he cut his head open.\r\n","[SUSAN] No, he wouldn't.\r\n","[BARBARA] They must have been forced open when we crashed.\r\n","[IAN] Crashed?\r\n","[SUSAN] No, the ship can't crash.

What's this?\r\n","[SUSAN] The coloured part is the ointment. You'll find the colourdisappearing. It goes into the wound. When the bandage is completelywhite, it means the wound is healed.\r\n","[IAN] Did you do that?\r\n","[SUSAN] We haven't moved.\r\n","[SUSAN] I'm going to try the controls.\r\n","[BARBARA] Be careful, Susan.\r\n","[IAN] She's fainted.

That's where we nearly lost the Tardis,four or five journey's back.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, the planet Quinnis, of the fourth universe.\r\n","[SUSAN] That's not outside either. That's a photograph.\r\n","[IAN] Can you explain it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Did I ever tell you that the ship has a memory bank, hmm?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes, it records our journeys.\r\n","[IAN] No, I don't think so.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Are you sure? I thought I did.\r\n","[SUSAN] Hey, look.\r\n","[IAN] Well, what's all that about?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, don't you know?

I know now who's responsible. You are. You sabotagedmy ship.\r\n","[BARBARA] We didn't even touch your ship.\r\n","[IAN] (overlapping) What are you talking about?\r\n","[DOCTOR] You're the cause of this disaster. And you knocked both Susanand I unconscious.\r\n","[BARBARA] Don't be ridiculous. We were all knocked out.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A charade. You attacked us.\r\n","[IAN] Absolute nonsense.\r\n","[DOCTOR] And when we were lying helpless on the floor, you tampered withmy controls.\r\n","[IAN] But you checked everything yourself and you couldn't find anythingwrong with it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, sir. We checked everything. You and I.\r\n","[BARBARA] But why would we? For what reason?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Blackmail, that's why. You tried to force me to return you toEngland.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, don't be so stupid.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I know it. I'm sure of it.\r\n","[BARBARA] How dare you! Do you realise, you stupid old man, that you'dhave died in the Cave of Skulls if Ian hadn't made fire for you?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, I\r\n","[BARBARA] And what about what we went through against the Daleks? Notjust for us, but for you and Susan too. And all because you tricked usinto going down to the city.\r\n","[DOCTOR] But I, I\r\n","[BARBARA] Accuse us? You ought to go down on your hands and knees andthank us. But gratitude's the last thing you'll ever have, or any sortof common sense either.\r\n","[IAN] You can't blame us for this, Doctor. Where is he?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I've decided we need more time to think. We're all somewhatoverwrought. Mister Chesterton. (offers the cups around) Miss Wright.Susan.\r\n","[IAN] I wish I could understand you, Doctor. One moment you're abusingus, and the next, you're playing the perfect butler.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A little nightcap to help us relax and sleep.\r\n","[IAN] If it is night. We have no way of telling now.\r\n","[BARBARA] I'm going to bed.\r\n","[SUSAN] Make it up with her, Grandfather. Please do.\r\n","[IAN] Doctor, some very strange things are happening. I feel we're in avery dangerous position. This is no time for personal quarrels.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Meaning?\r\n","[IAN] I think you should go and apologise to Barbara at once.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid we have no time for codes and manners. And Icertainly don't underestimate the dangers, if they exist. But I musthave time to think. I must think. Rash action is worse than no actionat all, hmm?\r\n","[IAN] I don't see anything rash in apologising to Barbara.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Room)\r\n","[IAN] Frankly, Doctor, I find it hard to keep pacewith you.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You mean, to keep one jump ahead. That you will never be. Youneed my knowledge and ability to apply it, and then you need myexperience to gain the fullest results.\r\n","[IAN] Results? For good or for evil?\r\n","[DOCTOR] One man's law is another man's crime. Sleep on it, Chesterton.Sleep on it.\r\n","[SUSAN] I'm sorry for what Grandfather said to you.\r\n","[BARBARA] It wasn't your fault.\r\n","[SUSAN] I know, but, try and understand him. Forgive him.\r\n","[BARBARA] Try and get some sleep.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Tardis)\r\n","[DOCTOR] So, it was you?\r\n","[BARBARA] Ian!\r\n","[DOCTOR] It's no use pretending.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, help him.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Help him? You saw him. You saw what he tried to do.\r\n","[BARBARA] But now he's fainted just like Susan did.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Susan didn't faint. It was you that told me she fainted and Ivery nearly believed you.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, what does it matter?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Matter? Matter, young lady? He very nearly tried to strangleme.\r\n","[BARBARA] But he has fainted. Look at him.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, he's play-acting.\r\n","[BARBARA] No, he isn't. Oh, Doctor, don't you see? Something terrible'shappening to all of us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Not to me. Nothing's happened to me. This is a plot between thetwo of you to get control of my ship.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, that isn't true.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Can't you see I've found you out? Why won't you admit it, hmm?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Why don't you?\r\n","[BARBARA] Susan!\r\n","[SUSAN] You've been behaving very strangely. Both of you.\r\n","[BARBARA] But.\r\n","[SUSAN] I think you're right, Grandfather.\r\n","[BARBARA] But you're wrong.

For heaven's sake, wake up, Ian. Ian, Ian, helpme.\r\n","[IAN] I, I, I\r\n","[DOCTOR] There's no alternative. Your little trick endangered our lives.\r\n","[SUSAN] How did he get like this?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's all a charade.\r\n","[BARBARA] He went near the control panel.\r\n","[SUSAN] It did happen to me, Grandfather.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes, you remember. You lost your memory. And there was thisterrible pain at the back of your neck.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Yes, that's true.\r\n","[BARBARA] What do you think we've done? Hypnotised you? Drugged you?Susan, we wouldn't do anything like that. Believe me.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I see. Divide and conquer, eh? She's trying to poison your mindagainst me.\r\n","[IAN] (suddenly sitting up) Don't touch it, Doctor! (and falling backagain)\r\n","[SUSAN] I do believe you. Grandfather, they couldn't have done all thethings that happened.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes, I admit they were very smart.\r\n","[SUSAN] No, it's not a question of being smart.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you see I wouldn't allow them to hurt you, child? They'revery resourceful and cunning, and it only leaves me one recourse. Theymust be put off the ship.\r\n","[SUSAN] No! You can't do that!\r\n","[DOCTOR] I can and I must.\r\n","[BARBARA] But you can't open the doors.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Don't underestimate my powers, young lady.\r\n","[SUSAN] Look, Grandfather. You've no means of telling what's out there.There may be no air, it may be freezing, it may be too hot to exist.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, or it might be the Earth in the twentieth century. Hadn'tit occurred to you? My ship is very valuable, remember?\r\n","[BARBARA] Why are you so suspicious of us?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Put yourself in my place, young lady, and you'd do preciselythe same thing, wouldn't you? Hmm?\r\n","[IAN] What are you two saying to each other?\r\n","[DOCTOR] You're getting off the ship, Chesterton.\r\n","[IAN] Now?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Now. Get up.\r\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] I'll be all right when I get outside.\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, Grandfather. He doesn't know what's happening. I won't letyou do this.\r\n","[DOCTOR] If, of course, they'd like to confess to me what they have doneto my ship, I may even change my mind.\r\n","[BARBARA] What, what was that?\r\n","[SUSAN] The danger signal.\r\n","[DOCTOR] The fault locator! The whole of it!\r\n","[IAN] Oh, don't touch it, Doctor.\r\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\r\n","[IAN] No. No, you'll get knocked out.\r\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Ian.\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, tell me.\r\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\r\n","[DOCTOR] The whole area of the fault locator has just given us awarning.\r\n","[SUSAN] But everything can't be. Everything can't be wrong!\r\n","[DOCTOR] That's what it means, child.\r\n","[BARBARA] No! Ian! Ian, it's all right. It's, it's all right. It's allright.\r\n","[IAN] I pulled you away. The controls are alive. (passes out)\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, you mustn't be frightened of me. Not now, please. I can'texplain, but I've just realised the danger we're in.\r\n","[SUSAN] It went off again, Grandfather.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hurry. Look. We must pull him round. You see that panel upthere? You've heard me refer to it? The fault locator?\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] If one small piece of apparatus fails, a little bulbilluminates and tells me precisely where the fault is. Can you imaginewhat would happen if the whole of it lights up? Hmm? It means that theship is on the point of disintegration. You're not to blame. All fourof us are to blame!\r\n","[IAN] Oh, you're all right. That drink you gave us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, a mere harmless sleeping drug.\r\n","[IAN] I thought so.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you rather suspected I was up to some mischief.\r\n","[IAN] Yes. And I told you not to go near the control column. I told youyou'll electrocute yourself.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid I must have misjudged you both.\r\n","[SUSAN] Fifteen seconds. It's happening every fifteen seconds.\r\n","[BARBARA] But all the clock are\r\n","[SUSAN] I counted.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well please go on counting. Now both of you listen. Can youconcentrate?\r\n","[IAN] Yes, I think I'm all right.\r\n","[DOCTOR] We're on the brink of destruction, so all four of us must workclosely together. We must find out where we are and what is happeningto my ship.\r\n","[IAN] Just a moment. Why did you say that, the brink of destruction?\r\n","[DOCTOR] There's a strong force at work somewhere, which is threateningmy ship. It's so strong that every piece of equipment can be out ofaction at the same time.\r\n","[IAN] What? Total disintegration?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. We haven't crash-landed, otherwise I would havediscovered that immediately. And I don't believe there's an evilintelligence in the ship. Just at the same token, I don't reallybelieve that you, either of you, have been the cause of this trouble.\r\n","[IAN] Well, what is, then?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, but we must find out.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, but how long have we got?\r\n","[SUSAN] It's definitely every quarter of a minute.\r\n","[IAN] Well what does that prove?\r\n","[BARBARA] That we have a measure of time as long as it lasts. Yes, ofcourse. That explains the clock face. We had time taken away from us,and now it's being given back to us because it's running out.\r\n","[SUSAN] The column.\r\n","[DOCTOR] But, it's impossible.\r\n","[IAN] Doctor, I thought it only moved when the power was on.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. The heart of the machine is under the column.\r\n","[IAN] Well what made it move?\r\n","[DOCTOR] The source of power. You see, when the column rises, it provesthe extent of the power thrust.\r\n","[BARBARA] Then what would have happened if the column had come outcompletely?\r\n","[SUSAN] Well, the power would be free to escape.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Can it be possible then, that this is the end?\r\n","[IAN] The end? What are you talking about?\r\n","[DOCTOR] We have ten minutes to survive.\r\n","[BARBARA] Ten minutes? As little as that?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Maybe less.\r\n","[IAN] Be careful, Doctor.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's quite safe here. This is where I stood when I triedthe scanner switch.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Yes. Why is that part safe?\r\n","[SUSAN] We'll never stop it in time!\r\n","[BARBARA] Don't, Susan. Please don't.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know even where to begin, Chesterton. If only I had aclue.\r\n","[BARBARA] I think. I think, perhaps, we've been given nothing else butclues.\r\n","[IAN] Have we? Like the food machine, you mean.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] It registered empty, but it wasn't.\r\n","[BARBARA] But the clock is the most important. It made us aware of time.\r\n","[SUSAN] By taking time away from us.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes. And it replaced time by the light on the fault locator.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, it did.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It? It? What do you mean? My machine can't think.\r\n","[BARBARA] You say it has a built-in defence mechanism?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it has.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well that's where we've been wrong. Originally, the machinewasn't at fault, we were. And it's been trying to tell us so eversince.\r\n","[IAN] A machine that can think for itself?\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] Is that feasible, Doctor?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, think not as you or I do, but it must be able to think as amachine. You see, it has a bank of computers.\r\n","[BARBARA] You say the power is under this column?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\r\n","[BARBARA] And the column holds it down.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, then, what would make it want to escape?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I've been racking my brains. I don't know.\r\n","[IAN] Something outside?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, possible.\r\n","[IAN] A magnetic force?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well, it would have to be a gigantic one. A one as strong as asolar system.\r\n","[BARBARA] You see? The machine's been warning us all along. All thoseblackouts we had.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. But only if anybody went near the control column.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] But it could be the power escaping.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, it couldn't. If you felt the power, dear boy, youwouldn't live to speak of it. You'd be blown to atoms in a splitsecond.\r\n","[SUSAN] Besides, it's the part of it that's safe.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes. The scanner. I wonder.\r\n","[DOCTOR] We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again,I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you seeoutside, understand?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I lied, deliberately, so that they won't know.\r\n","[IAN] Won't know what?\r\n","[DOCTOR] We have five minutes only. When the end does come, they won'tknow anything about it.\r\n","[IAN] There's no hope, then.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I can't see any. Will you face it with me?\r\n","[SUSAN] What are you two talking about?\r\n","[IAN] Oh, just a theory of mine that didn't work.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we must solve this problem, you know. We must.\r\n","[SUSAN] There's nothing there. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing but space.\r\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Susan.\r\n","[IAN] Barbara could be right, Doctor.\r\n","[BARBARA] I am right. I know I am. Whenever there's a good picture, thedoors open because it's safe for us to go outside. And then it shows usa terrible picture and the doors close again.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, then we have the sequence. A planet, a planet in the solarsystem, getting further away. Blinding flash. Destruction. Yes, ofcourse. It's our journey.\r\n","[BARBARA] And the ship refused to destroy itself.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Yes!\r\n","[BARBARA] The defence mechanism stopped the ship, and it's been tryingto tell us so ever since!\r\n","[DOCTOR] Of course. Of course!\r\n","[DOCTOR] I know. I know. I said it would take the force of a total solarsystem to attract the power away from my ship. We're at the verybeginning, the new start of a solar system. Outside, the atoms arerushing towards each other. Fusing, coagulating, until minute littlecollections of matter are created. And so the process goes on, and onuntil dust is formed. Dust then becomes solid entity. A new birth, of asun and its planets.\r\n","[IAN] But, Doctor, where are we? When we left the planet Skaro, wheredid you ask the machine to take us to? Think, Doctor!\r\n","[DOCTOR] I, er, had hoped to reach your planet Earth. Skaro was in thefuture and I used the fast return switch.\r\n","[IAN] The fast return switch? You've sent us back too far. Doctor, showme. Show me that switch. Where is it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well, I can't very well see it without a light, can I?\r\n","[SUSAN] It's near the scanner switch.\r\n","[BARBARA] Really? But that's the part of the control that's safe.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Strange.\r\n","[IAN] Doctor, we haven't got very much time left.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I see. Here it is. (pulls a small torch from his pocket)Here, you see? Now, look, there's the switch. You see?\r\n","[IAN] Yes, well how does it work?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well, you merely press it down, and. It's stuck. It hasn'treleased itself!\r\n","[IAN] What? You mean it's been on all this time?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it must have been.\r\n","[IAN] Well, come on, Doctor. Let's get it unstuck.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hold that. Yes, just a minute now. Yes, there you are, you see?\r\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\r\n","[DOCTOR] The spring's not connecting. It's come off the base.\r\n","[IAN] Hurry, Doctor, hurry.\r\n","[DOCTOR] There we are. Take it out. Now, luckily we can turn it over andnow it should work. There. Ah, that's all right.\r\n","[SUSAN] We're safe now.\r\n","[BARBARA] Are you sure?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we can all relax. We're quite safe now. But it was anarrow squeak.\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my child?\r\n","[SUSAN] What happened?\r\n","[DOCTOR] What happened? It was the switch. It was still in place. Yousee, there's a little spring inside it and it was stuck. It hadn'treleased itself.\r\n","[SUSAN] But why didn't the fault locator tell us?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well, the switch hadn't broken down, therefore the faultlocator couldn't give us any recognition. You see, let me give you ademonstration. (using his torch) Now, look, when I put my thumb onthere, the light comes on. And it only stays on so long as my thumb ispressing that switch. As soon as I take if off, a little spring insidereleases the switch here and out goes the light.\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I see. So if the spring were broken, it would be as if yourfinger were pressing it down all the time.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. As simple as that. You know, my dear child, I thinkyour old grandfather is going a tiny little bit around the bend. Well,I think you were very brave and I was proud of you.\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather? What about them? You said some terrible things tothem. When I thought he was going to attack you, even I was againsthim.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I, I, er, well\r\n","[IAN] Don't bother to say anything, Doctor. You know there are timeswhen I can read every thought on your face.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Really? And I always thought that you were a young man withoutany recrimination in you. Well, as for you, young lady, well, you wereabsolutely right. It was your instinct and intuition against my logic,and you succeeded. I mean, the blackouts, and the still pictures andthe clock. Well, you read a story into all these things and weredetermined to hold on to it. We all owe you our lives.\r\n","[BARBARA] I, I\r\n","[DOCTOR] You know, I really believe I have underestimated that younglady in the past, Chartow. Well now, we can all start again, eh? Yes,we can. Yes. But which? Hmm? What are you laughing at, dear boy? Oh,really, you are\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Room)\r\n","[DOCTOR] I'd like to talk to you, if I may.

Young lady, I've been underestimatingyou.\n","[IAN] I will not allow you to use the Thals to fight for us.\n","[DOCTOR] Are you challenging me?\n","[IAN] Yes, I am.\n","[BARBARA] Do I have any say in this?\n","[IAN] Of course you do.\n","[BARBARA] Well I think the Doctor's right and I want to get out of here.\n","[IAN] I am sorry, I'm not having anyone's death on my conscience.\n","[BARBARA] Except mine and Susan's and the Doctor's?\n","[DOCTOR] Quite so.\n","[IAN] The only way the Thals can fight is if they themselves want to. Itmust have nothing whatsoever to do with us.\n","[SUSAN] I know what you mean. We must help the Thals to save themselvesand not just them help us.\n","[IAN] Exactly.\n","[BARBARA] All you're doing is playing with words.\n","[DOCTOR] We need action, not arguments.\n","[IAN] Now listen, you two. What victory are you going to show thesepeople when most of them have been killed? A fluid link? Is this whatyou're going to hold up to them and say, 'Thank you very much. This iswhat you fought and died for'?\n","[SUSAN] The thing is, can the Thals still fight?\n","[IAN] Well that's what we've got to find out. Are they cowards, or arethey just against fighting on principle?\n","[BARBARA] Well, how can we find out?\n","[IAN] Well, I've got an idea. But whatever I do, don't interfere. I'mnot even sure that I'm right.\n","[IAN] Well, let's see what happens.\n","[DOCTOR] Hmm, strange young man.\n","[SUSAN] He's right, though.\n","[BARBARA] Yes, he is.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we'll see.\n","[IAN] to have self- respect. At this moment, anyone could come in here.They could rob, they could steal.\n","[DOCTOR] Let's see what he's up to.\n","[IAN] They could even kill you. And you wouldn't lift a finger to helpyourselves.\n","[ALYDON] We will not fight. There will be no more wars. Look at ourplanet. This was once a great world, full of ideas and art andinvention. In one day it was destroyed. And you will never find onegood reason why we should ever begin destroying everything again. I'msorry.\n","[IAN] You're not sorry. You stand here, mumbling a lot of words out ofyour history. But it means nothing, nothing at all. You carry thisaround with you. Your history records. Well, it must be valuable toyou. Supposing I take it down to the city and try and trade with theDaleks? Perhaps they'd think it valuable enough to exchange for ourfluid link.\n","[ALYDON] I don't believe you'd do it.\n","[IAN] I would.\n","[ALYDON] None of us would stop you.\n","[IAN] If I don't get the fluid link back, the four of us will die.Perhaps the Daleks are more interested in people? Maybe they wereholding us to experiment on us? I could take them an alternative.\n","[IAN] So there is something you'll fight for.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Experiment chamber)\n","[DALEK] Help. Cannot control.

Is this the end of the Daleks?\n","[DALEK 2] We need radiation to survive. So we must increase our supplyof radiation.\n","[DALEK 1] But there is only one way to do that.\n","[DALEK 2] Exactly. We may have to explode another neutron bomb.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Thal camp)\n","[DYONI] Why don't you sleep?\n","[ALYDON] Presently.\n","[DYONI] Are you angry with yourself for striking the young man?\n","[ALYDON] No, I knew he was trying to make me do it.

Do you despise me for hitting him?\n","[DYONI] If you hadn't fought him, I think I would have hated you.\n","[ALYDON] I knew he wouldn't really take you and give you to the Daleks.But I fought him. Oh, I wish Temmosus were here. What would he havesaid, Dyoni? Which is the most important? To fight and live, or to diewithout fighting.\n","[BARBARA] What will happen now?\n","[GANATUS] I don't know. We always do what the leader of our race decidesfor us. He never decides anything without our full approval.\n","[BARBARA] And if Alydon decides not to help us? Well, we'll have to waittill the morning. What's that light in the sky? It's a reflection fromthe city, I suppose.\n","[GANATUS] No, the lake. Some sort of chemical in the water that makes itglow in the moonlight.\n","[BARBARA] You've been down there?\n","[GANATUS] Yes. There's horror down there in the swamp. Five of us wentthere in search of food, and only my brother and I came back.\n","[BARBARA] What happened to the others?\n","[GANATUS] Well, we found what was left of one of them. The lake is alivewith mutations, bred and crossbred until the original has long beenreplaced by. I'm sorry, I'm being morbid.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I don't mind as long as we're this far away. But I wonderwhy the Daleks haven't cleaned it out? Killed everything?\n","[GANATUS] Why should they? Isn't it the perfect defence for the back ofa city? Only a fool would attack the city from the lake.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Control room)\n","[DALEK 2] Has the anti-radiation drug distribution been stopped?\n","[DALEK 3] Yes. Only Daleks in section two and three received it.

If wedo not help you, what will you do?\n","[IAN] We'll find our way into the city, and take back our lostequipment.\n","[ALYDON] You see, we cannot stand by and let these people die. If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die. But there is a terrible shame inbeing afraid to live. If none of you agree with my reasons, then let mego with these people, and I will help you elect a new chief.\n","[GANATUS] I'll go with you, Alydon.\n","[THAL] And I.\n","[THAL 2] Let's start at once.\n","[ANTODUS] And I.\n","[IAN] Thank you.\n","[ALYDON] You knew what my decision would be.\n","[GANATUS] I could always have destroyed it if you'd decided differently.\n","[DOCTOR] If we get this intelligent anticipation, we shall succeed.Let's see this. Now, what is this area here?\n","[GANATUS] The swamp. Here are the mountains. This is the far side of thecity. I've been into the swamp. It's surrounded by lakes, here, as yousee. The lakes are inhabited by all sorts of strange creatures.\n","[IAN] Can we get into the city this way?\n","[ALYDON] Over the mountains?\n","[IAN] Yes.\n","[GANATUS] That means going through that swamp.\n","[ALYDON] We can't go through the swamp. It's too dangerous.\n","[GANATUS] It is dangerous, yes, but I realised last night when I wastalking to Barbara that it is undefended.\n","[ALYDON] Undefended? It's a perfect natural barrier. All thosecreatures, you know that yourself.\n","[GANATUS] Yes, I know, but I mean the Daleks won't be on guard there.There's a chance to take them by surprise. Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\n","[ALYDON] Yes. Very well then. That is what we must do.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Control room)\n","[DALEK 2] The laser scope is transmitting. Thequality is poor. What has happened?

Except for one serious case, allDaleks in section two have shown signs of recovery.\n","[DALEK 2] Then our position is clear. For us, the drug is a poison.\n","[DALEK 1] And radiation is still necessary to us.\n","[DALEK 2] Essential. I want a complete survey of our stock of nuclearmaterials.

It's your duty to tell them. How we watchedAmezus dragged beneath the waters of the lake, while you and I ran interror when\n","[GANATUS] That's enough. We're going on, Antodus. You keep your fears toyourself. I don't want you upsetting the others. Is that clear?\n","[ANTODUS] Yes.\n","[GANATUS] Well, is it?\n","[ANTODUS] Yes!\n","[GANATUS] Well, this is the swamp. From now on it's going to be ratheruncomfortable.\n","[IAN] Yes, I see what you mean.\n","[GANATUS] The ground's very uneven. Sometimes rock, sometimes thick mud.You'll have to watch how you walk. I think it'll be a wise plan to finda place to rest for the night.\n","[IAN] Yes. We've made very good time. It's only taken four hours to gethere from the edge of the forest. That leaves us with two and a halfdays to go through the mountains to the city.\n","[GANATUS] If there is a way through.\n","[IAN] We'll find a way. I'll go and give Barbara a hand.\n","[GANATUS] I'm surprised you let her come.\n","[IAN] I'd be more surprised if I could have stopped her. How are youdoing?\n","[BARBARA] Fine. Oh, I'm glad the mountaineering's over.\n","[IAN] There'll be some more once we get through this little lot.\n","[BARBARA] We're going through there?\n","[IAN] Well, we must. We've got a deadline with the Doctor in two and ahalf days, and we've got to make it.\n","[BARBARA] Well I think we could all do with a rest.\n","[IAN] No, we'll keep up with the others. They'll be breaking camp soon.Now take care. Watch where you put your feet.

See if we can gather up some drybranches.\n","[IAN] All right.\n","[GANATUS] It'll make it more comfortable to sleep on. Barbara, you seeto the food.

I'll come with you. Morning.\n","[BARBARA] Morning. Oh, for a feather pillow and a spring mattress.\n","[GANATUS] What did you see?\n","[ELYON] Over there.\n","[IAN] We were right. The Daleks do get their water from the lake.\n","[GANATUS] But how would it get to the city from there?\n","[IAN] Well, there must be a way. I mean, the Daleks aren't very mobile.They must have cut a pathway through there to work on the pipeline.\n","[GANATUS] How long do you think it will take us to reach there?\n","[ELYON] Most of today. If we could cross the lake we could reach it muchquicker.\n","[IAN] I'm sorry, that's one way I'm not going.\n","[ELYON] Well, it would be dangerous, certainly. The lake is full ofmutations.\n","[GANATUS] No, we must go round.\n","[IAN] Yes, and we ought to try and get there before the sun goes down.\n","[ELYON] Well I'll just go and fill the water bags. (a little away fromIan) There's no point in trying to cross the lake, you think?\n","[GANATUS] No. No, he's right.

I thought you might be able to explain it.\n","[IAN] Why me?\n","[DOCTOR] Trying to confuse me, eh?\n","[IAN] What are you getting at?\n","[BARBARA] Look, why don't we just try and open the doors and see forourselves what's outside?\n","[DOCTOR] What is inside, madam, is most important at the moment.\n","[BARBARA] Inside?\n","[IAN] But you've just been telling us that the only people inside areourselves.\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. I know now who's responsible. You are. You sabotagedmy ship.\n","[BARBARA] We didn't even touch your ship.\n","[IAN] (overlapping) What are you talking about?\n","[DOCTOR] You're the cause of this disaster. And you knocked both Susanand I unconscious.\n","[BARBARA] Don't be ridiculous. We were all knocked out.\n","[DOCTOR] A charade. You attacked us.\n","[IAN] Absolute nonsense.\n","[DOCTOR] And when we were lying helpless on the floor, you tampered withmy controls.\n","[IAN] But you checked everything yourself and you couldn't find anythingwrong with it.\n","[DOCTOR] No, sir. We checked everything. You and I.\n","[BARBARA] But why would we? For what reason?\n","[DOCTOR] Blackmail, that's why. You tried to force me to return you toEngland.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, don't be so stupid.\n","[DOCTOR] I know it. I'm sure of it.\n","[BARBARA] How dare you! Do you realise, you stupid old man, that you'dhave died in the Cave of Skulls if Ian hadn't made fire for you?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, I\n","[BARBARA] And what about what we went through against the Daleks? Notjust for us, but for you and Susan too. And all because you tricked usinto going down to the city.\n","[DOCTOR] But I, I\n","[BARBARA] Accuse us? You ought to go down on your hands and knees andthank us. But gratitude's the last thing you'll ever have, or any sortof common sense either.\n","[IAN] You can't blame us for this, Doctor. Where is he?\n","[DOCTOR] I've decided we need more time to think. We're all somewhatoverwrought. Mister Chesterton. (offers the cups around) Miss Wright.Susan.\n","[IAN] I wish I could understand you, Doctor. One moment you're abusingus, and the next, you're playing the perfect butler.\n","[DOCTOR] A little nightcap to help us relax and sleep.\n","[IAN] If it is night. We have no way of telling now.\n","[BARBARA] I'm going to bed.\n","[SUSAN] Make it up with her, Grandfather. Please do.\n","[IAN] Doctor, some very strange things are happening. I feel we're in avery dangerous position. This is no time for personal quarrels.\n","[DOCTOR] Meaning?\n","[IAN] I think you should go and apologise to Barbara at once.\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid we have no time for codes and manners. And Icertainly don't underestimate the dangers, if they exist. But I musthave time to think. I must think. Rash action is worse than no actionat all, hmm?\n","[IAN] I don't see anything rash in apologising to Barbara.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Room)\n","[IAN] Frankly, Doctor, I find it hard to keep pacewith you.\n","[DOCTOR] You mean, to keep one jump ahead. That you will never be. Youneed my knowledge and ability to apply it, and then you need myexperience to gain the fullest results.\n","[IAN] Results? For good or for evil?\n","[DOCTOR] One man's law is another man's crime. Sleep on it, Chesterton.Sleep on it.\n","[SUSAN] I'm sorry for what Grandfather said to you.\n","[BARBARA] It wasn't your fault.\n","[SUSAN] I know, but, try and understand him. Forgive him.\n","[BARBARA] Try and get some sleep.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Tardis)\n","[DOCTOR] So, it was you?\n","[BARBARA] Ian!\n","[DOCTOR] It's no use pretending.\n","[BARBARA] Well, help him.\n","[DOCTOR] Help him? You saw him. You saw what he tried to do.\n","[BARBARA] But now he's fainted just like Susan did.\n","[DOCTOR] Susan didn't faint. It was you that told me she fainted and Ivery nearly believed you.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, what does it matter?\n","[DOCTOR] Matter? Matter, young lady? He very nearly tried to strangleme.\n","[BARBARA] But he has fainted. Look at him.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, he's play-acting.\n","[BARBARA] No, he isn't. Oh, Doctor, don't you see? Something terrible'shappening to all of us.\n","[DOCTOR] Not to me. Nothing's happened to me. This is a plot between thetwo of you to get control of my ship.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, that isn't true.\n","[DOCTOR] Can't you see I've found you out? Why won't you admit it, hmm?\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Why don't you?\n","[BARBARA] Susan!\n","[SUSAN] You've been behaving very strangely. Both of you.\n","[BARBARA] But.\n","[SUSAN] I think you're right, Grandfather.\n","[BARBARA] But you're wrong. I swear we haven't done anything.\n","[DOCTOR] I told you i'd treat you as enemies.\n","[SUSAN] No!\n","[DOCTOR] There's no other way.\n","[BARBARA] Well what are you going to do?\n","[DOCTOR] That is my business.\n","[BARBARA] Ian, wake up. For heaven's sake, wake up, Ian. Ian, Ian, helpme.\n","[IAN] I, I, I\n","[DOCTOR] There's no alternative. Your little trick endangered our lives.\n","[SUSAN] How did he get like this?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's all a charade.\n","[BARBARA] He went near the control panel.\n","[SUSAN] It did happen to me, Grandfather.\n","[BARBARA] Yes, you remember. You lost your memory. And there was thisterrible pain at the back of your neck.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Yes, that's true.\n","[BARBARA] What do you think we've done? Hypnotised you? Drugged you?Susan, we wouldn't do anything like that. Believe me.\n","[DOCTOR] I see. Divide and conquer, eh? She's trying to poison your mindagainst me.\n","[IAN] (suddenly sitting up) Don't touch it, Doctor! (and falling backagain)\n","[SUSAN] I do believe you. Grandfather, they couldn't have done all thethings that happened.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes, I admit they were very smart.\n","[SUSAN] No, it's not a question of being smart.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you see I wouldn't allow them to hurt you, child? They'revery resourceful and cunning, and it only leaves me one recourse. Theymust be put off the ship.\n","[SUSAN] No! You can't do that!\n","[DOCTOR] I can and I must.\n","[BARBARA] But you can't open the doors.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't underestimate my powers, young lady.\n","[SUSAN] Look, Grandfather. You've no means of telling what's out there.There may be no air, it may be freezing, it may be too hot to exist.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, or it might be the Earth in the twentieth century. Hadn'tit occurred to you? My ship is very valuable, remember?\n","[BARBARA] Why are you so suspicious of us?\n","[DOCTOR] Put yourself in my place, young lady, and you'd do preciselythe same thing, wouldn't you? Hmm?\n","[IAN] What are you two saying to each other?\n","[DOCTOR] You're getting off the ship, Chesterton.\n","[IAN] Now?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Now. Get up.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] I'll be all right when I get outside.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, Grandfather. He doesn't know what's happening. I won't letyou do this.\n","[DOCTOR] If, of course, they'd like to confess to me what they have doneto my ship, I may even change my mind.\n","[BARBARA] What, what was that?\n","[SUSAN] The danger signal.\n","[DOCTOR] The fault locator! The whole of it!\n","[IAN] Oh, don't touch it, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[IAN] No. No, you'll get knocked out.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Ian.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, tell me.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[DOCTOR] The whole area of the fault locator has just given us awarning.\n","[SUSAN] But everything can't be. Everything can't be wrong!\n","[DOCTOR] That's what it means, child.\n","[BARBARA] No! Ian! Ian, it's all right. It's, it's all right. It's allright.\n","[IAN] I pulled you away. The controls are alive. (passes out)\n","[DOCTOR] No, you mustn't be frightened of me. Not now, please. I can'texplain, but I've just realised the danger we're in.\n","[SUSAN] It went off again, Grandfather.\n","[DOCTOR] Hurry. Look. We must pull him round. You see that panel upthere? You've heard me refer to it? The fault locator?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] If one small piece of apparatus fails, a little bulbilluminates and tells me precisely where the fault is. Can you imaginewhat would happen if the whole of it lights up? Hmm? It means that theship is on the point of disintegration. You're not to blame. All fourof us are to blame!\n","[IAN] Oh, you're all right. That drink you gave us.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, a mere harmless sleeping drug.\n","[IAN] I thought so.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you rather suspected I was up to some mischief.\n","[IAN] Yes. And I told you not to go near the control column. I told youyou'll electrocute yourself.\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid I must have misjudged you both.\n","[SUSAN] Fifteen seconds. It's happening every fifteen seconds.\n","[BARBARA] But all the clock are\n","[SUSAN] I counted.\n","[DOCTOR] Well please go on counting. Now both of you listen. Can youconcentrate?\n","[IAN] Yes, I think I'm all right.\n","[DOCTOR] We're on the brink of destruction, so all four of us must workclosely together. We must find out where we are and what is happeningto my ship.\n","[IAN] Just a moment. Why did you say that, the brink of destruction?\n","[DOCTOR] There's a strong force at work somewhere, which is threateningmy ship. It's so strong that every piece of equipment can be out ofaction at the same time.\n","[IAN] What? Total disintegration?\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. We haven't crash-landed, otherwise I would havediscovered that immediately. And I don't believe there's an evilintelligence in the ship. Just at the same token, I don't reallybelieve that you, either of you, have been the cause of this trouble.\n","[IAN] Well, what is, then?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, but we must find out.\n","[IAN] Yes, but how long have we got?\n","[SUSAN] It's definitely every quarter of a minute.\n","[IAN] Well what does that prove?\n","[BARBARA] That we have a measure of time as long as it lasts. Yes, ofcourse. That explains the clock face. We had time taken away from us,and now it's being given back to us because it's running out.\n","[SUSAN] The column.\n","[DOCTOR] But, it's impossible.\n","[IAN] Doctor, I thought it only moved when the power was on.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. The heart of the machine is under the column.\n","[IAN] Well what made it move?\n","[DOCTOR] The source of power. You see, when the column rises, it provesthe extent of the power thrust.\n","[BARBARA] Then what would have happened if the column had come outcompletely?\n","[SUSAN] Well, the power would be free to escape.\n","[DOCTOR] Can it be possible then, that this is the end?\n","[IAN] The end? What are you talking about?\n","[DOCTOR] We have ten minutes to survive.\n","[BARBARA] Ten minutes? As little as that?\n","[DOCTOR] Maybe less.\n","[IAN] Be careful, Doctor.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's quite safe here. This is where I stood when I triedthe scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Yes. Why is that part safe?\n","[SUSAN] We'll never stop it in time!\n","[BARBARA] Don't, Susan. Please don't.\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know even where to begin, Chesterton. If only I had aclue.\n","[BARBARA] I think. I think, perhaps, we've been given nothing else butclues.\n","[IAN] Have we? Like the food machine, you mean.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] It registered empty, but it wasn't.\n","[BARBARA] But the clock is the most important. It made us aware of time.\n","[SUSAN] By taking time away from us.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. And it replaced time by the light on the fault locator.\n","[IAN] Yes, it did.\n","[DOCTOR] It? It? What do you mean? My machine can't think.\n","[BARBARA] You say it has a built-in defence mechanism?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it has.\n","[BARBARA] Well that's where we've been wrong. Originally, the machinewasn't at fault, we were. And it's been trying to tell us so eversince.\n","[IAN] A machine that can think for itself?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] Is that feasible, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, think not as you or I do, but it must be able to think as amachine. You see, it has a bank of computers.\n","[BARBARA] You say the power is under this column?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] And the column holds it down.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] Well, then, what would make it want to escape?\n","[DOCTOR] I've been racking my brains. I don't know.\n","[IAN] Something outside?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, possible.\n","[IAN] A magnetic force?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, it would have to be a gigantic one. A one as strong as asolar system.\n","[BARBARA] You see? The machine's been warning us all along. All thoseblackouts we had.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. But only if anybody went near the control column.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] But it could be the power escaping.\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, it couldn't. If you felt the power, dear boy, youwouldn't live to speak of it. You'd be blown to atoms in a splitsecond.\n","[SUSAN] Besides, it's the part of it that's safe.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. The scanner. I wonder.\n","[DOCTOR] We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.\n","[DOCTOR] Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again,I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you seeoutside, understand?\n","[DOCTOR] I lied, deliberately, so that they won't know.\n","[IAN] Won't know what?\n","[DOCTOR] We have five minutes only. When the end does come, they won'tknow anything about it.\n","[IAN] There's no hope, then.\n","[DOCTOR] I can't see any. Will you face it with me?\n","[SUSAN] What are you two talking about?\n","[IAN] Oh, just a theory of mine that didn't work.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we must solve this problem, you know. We must.\n","[SUSAN] There's nothing there. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing but space.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Susan.\n","[IAN] Barbara could be right, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] I am right. I know I am. Whenever there's a good picture, thedoors open because it's safe for us to go outside. And then it shows usa terrible picture and the doors close again.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, then we have the sequence. A planet, a planet in the solarsystem, getting further away. Blinding flash. Destruction. Yes, ofcourse. It's our journey.\n","[BARBARA] And the ship refused to destroy itself.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Yes!\n","[BARBARA] The defence mechanism stopped the ship, and it's been tryingto tell us so ever since!\n","[DOCTOR] Of course. Of course!\n","[DOCTOR] I know. I know. I said it would take the force of a total solarsystem to attract the power away from my ship. We're at the verybeginning, the new start of a solar system. Outside, the atoms arerushing towards each other. Fusing, coagulating, until minute littlecollections of matter are created. And so the process goes on, and onuntil dust is formed. Dust then becomes solid entity. A new birth, of asun and its planets.\n","[IAN] But, Doctor, where are we? When we left the planet Skaro, wheredid you ask the machine to take us to? Think, Doctor!\n","[DOCTOR] I, er, had hoped to reach your planet Earth. Skaro was in thefuture and I used the fast return switch.\n","[IAN] The fast return switch? You've sent us back too far. Doctor, showme. Show me that switch. Where is it?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, I can't very well see it without a light, can I?\n","[SUSAN] It's near the scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Really? But that's the part of the control that's safe.\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Strange.\n","[IAN] Doctor, we haven't got very much time left.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I see. Here it is. (pulls a small torch from his pocket)Here, you see? Now, look, there's the switch. You see?\n","[IAN] Yes, well how does it work?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, you merely press it down, and. It's stuck. It hasn'treleased itself!\n","[IAN] What? You mean it's been on all this time?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it must have been.\n","[IAN] Well, come on, Doctor. Let's get it unstuck.\n","[DOCTOR] Hold that. Yes, just a minute now. Yes, there you are, you see?\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\n","[DOCTOR] The spring's not connecting. It's come off the base.\n","[IAN] Hurry, Doctor, hurry.\n","[DOCTOR] There we are. Take it out. Now, luckily we can turn it over andnow it should work. There. Ah, that's all right.\n","[SUSAN] We're safe now.\n","[BARBARA] Are you sure?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we can all relax. We're quite safe now. But it was anarrow squeak.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my child?\n","[SUSAN] What happened?\n","[DOCTOR] What happened? It was the switch. It was still in place. Yousee, there's a little spring inside it and it was stuck. It hadn'treleased itself.\n","[SUSAN] But why didn't the fault locator tell us?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, the switch hadn't broken down, therefore the faultlocator couldn't give us any recognition. You see, let me give you ademonstration. (using his torch) Now, look, when I put my thumb onthere, the light comes on. And it only stays on so long as my thumb ispressing that switch. As soon as I take if off, a little spring insidereleases the switch here and out goes the light.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I see. So if the spring were broken, it would be as if yourfinger were pressing it down all the time.\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. As simple as that. You know, my dear child, I thinkyour old grandfather is going a tiny little bit around the bend. Well,I think you were very brave and I was proud of you.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather? What about them? You said some terrible things tothem. When I thought he was going to attack you, even I was againsthim.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I, I, er, well\n","[IAN] Don't bother to say anything, Doctor. You know there are timeswhen I can read every thought on your face.\n","[DOCTOR] Really? And I always thought that you were a young man withoutany recrimination in you. Well, as for you, young lady, well, you wereabsolutely right. It was your instinct and intuition against my logic,and you succeeded. I mean, the blackouts, and the still pictures andthe clock. Well, you read a story into all these things and weredetermined to hold on to it. We all owe you our lives.\n","[BARBARA] I, I\n","[DOCTOR] You know, I really believe I have underestimated that younglady in the past, Chartow. Well now, we can all start again, eh? Yes,we can. Yes. But which? Hmm? What are you laughing at, dear boy? Oh,really, you are\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Room)\n","[DOCTOR] I'd like to talk to you, if I may. We've landed on a planet andthe air is good, but it's rather cold outside.\n","[BARBARA] Susan told me.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you haven't forgiven me, have you.\n","[BARBARA] You said terrible things to us.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I suppose it's the injustice that's upsetting you, andwhen I made a threat to put you off the ship it must have affected youvery deeply.\n","[BARBARA] What do you care what I think or feel?\n","[DOCTOR] As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves.\n","[BARBARA] Perhaps.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes. Because I accused you unjustly, you were determined toprove me wrong. So, you put your mind to the problem and, luckily, yousolved it.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, we're going out now.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, please, yes.

The United States has a decimal system.You know perfectly well that we do not.\n","[SUSAN] Of course, the decimal system hasn't started yet.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Totter's Lane)\n","[IAN] I suppose she couldn't be a foreigner? No,doesn't make sense. Nothing about this girl makes sense. For instance,the other day I talking about chemical changes. I'd given out thelitmus paper to show cause and effect\n","[BARBARA] And she knew the answer before you'd started.\n","[IAN] Well, not quite. The answer simply didn't interest her.\n","[SUSAN] Yes, I can see red turns to blue, MisterChesterton, but that's because we're dealing with two inactivechemicals. They only act in relation to each other.\n","[IAN] But that's the whole point of the experiment, Susan.\n","[SUSAN] Yes, it's a bit obvious, isn't it? Well, I'm not trying to berude, but couldn't we deal with two active chemicals? Then red couldturn blue all by itself and get on with something else? I'm sorry, itwas just an idea.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Totter's Lane)\n","[IAN] She means it. These simple experiments arechild's play to her.\n","[BARBARA] You know, it's almost got to the point where I deliberatelywant to trip her up.\n","[IAN] Yes. Something like that happened the other day. I'd set the classa problem with A, B and C as the three dimensions.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Memory - classroom)\n","[SUSAN] It's impossible unless you use D and E.\n","[IAN] D and E? Whatever for? Do the problem that's set, Susan.\n","[SUSAN] I can't, Mister Chesterton. You can't simply work on three ofthe dimensions.\n","[IAN] Three of them? Oh, time being the fourth dimension, I suppose?Then what do you need E for? What do you make the fifth dimension?\n","[SUSAN] Space.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Totter's Lane)\n","[BARBARA] Too many questions and not enoughanswers.\n","[IAN] Stupid? Or just doesn't know. So we have a fifteen year old girlwho is absolutely brilliant at some things, and excruciatingly bad atothers.\n","[BARBARA] There she is.\n","[BARBARA] Look, can we go in now? I hate to think of her alone in thatplace.\n","[IAN] If she is alone. Look, she is fifteen. She might be meeting a boy.Didn't that occur to you?\n","[BARBARA] I almost hope she is.\n","[IAN] What do you mean?\n","[BARBARA] Well, it would be so wonderfully normal. It's silly, isn't it?I feel frightened. As if we're about to interfere in something that isbest left alone.\n","[IAN] Come on, let's get it over with.\n","[BARBARA] Well, don't you feel it?\n","[IAN] I take things as they come. Come on.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Junk yard)\n","[IAN] What a mess. We're not turning over any of this stuff to findher..\n","[BARBARA] Over there?\n","[IAN] Blast.

Mister Chesterton and Miss Wright. Shecan't have got out without us seeing her.\n","[BARBARA] Ian, look at this.\n","[IAN] It's a police box! What on earth's it doing here? These things areusually on the street. Feel it. Feel it. Do you feel it?\n","[BARBARA] It's a faint vibration.\n","[IAN] It's alive!\n","[IAN] It's not connected to anything, unless it's through the floor.\n","[BARBARA] Look, I've had enough. Let's go and find a policeman.\n","[IAN] Yes, all right.\n","[BARBARA] Is that her?\n","[IAN] That's not her. Quick.\n","[SUSAN [OC]] There you are, Grandfather.\n","[BARBARA] It's Susan.\n","[IAN] Shush!\n","[IAN] Excuse me.\n","[DOCTOR] What are you doing here?\n","[IAN] We're looking for a young girl.\n","[DOCTOR] We?\n","[BARBARA] Good evening.\n","[DOCTOR] What do you want?\n","[IAN] One of our pupils, Susan Foreman, came into this yard.\n","[DOCTOR] Really? In here? Are you sure?\n","[BARBARA] Yes, we saw her from across the street.\n","[DOCTOR] (aside) One of their pupils, not the police, then.\n","[IAN] I beg your pardon?\n","[DOCTOR] Why were you were spying on her? Who are you?\n","[IAN] We heard a young girl's voice call out to you.\n","[DOCTOR] Your hearing must be very acute. I didn't hear anything.\n","[BARBARA] It came from in here.\n","[DOCTOR] You imagined it.\n","[BARBARA] I certainly did not imagine it.\n","[DOCTOR] Young man, is it reasonable to suppose that anybody would beinside a cupboard like that, hmm?\n","[IAN] Would it therefore be unreasonable to ask you to let us have alook inside?\n","[DOCTOR] I wonder why I've never seen that before. Now isn't thatstrange. Very damp and dirty.\n","[BARBARA] Won't you help us? We're two of her teachers from the CoalHill School. We saw her come in and we haven't seen her leave.Naturally, we're worried.\n","[DOCTOR] Have to be cleaned. Hmm? Oh, I'm afraid it's none of mybusiness. I suggest you leave here.\n","[IAN] Not until we're satisfied that Susan isn't in there. And frankly,I don't understand your attitude.\n","[DOCTOR] Yours leaves a lot to be desired.\n","[IAN] Will you open the door?\n","[DOCTOR] There's nothing in there.\n","[IAN] Then what are you afraid to show us?\n","[DOCTOR] Afraid? Oh, go away.\n","[IAN] I think we'd better go and fetch a policeman.\n","[DOCTOR] Very well.\n","[IAN] And you're coming with us.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, am I? I don't think so, young man. No, I don't think so.\n","[BARBARA] We can't force him.\n","[IAN] But we can't leave him here. Doesn't it seem obvious to you he'sgot her locked up in there? Look at it. There's no door handle. Theremust be a secret lock somewhere.\n","[BARBARA] That was Susan's voice.\n","[IAN] But of course it was. Susan! Susan! Susan, are you in there? It'sMister Chesterton and Miss Wright, Susan.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you think you're being rather high-handed, young man? Youthought you saw a young girl enter the yard. You imagine you heard hervoice. You believe she might be inside there. It's not verysubstantial, is it?\n","[BARBARA] But why won't you help us?\n","[DOCTOR] I'm not hindering you. If you both want to make fools ofyourselves, I suggest you do what you said you'd do. Go and find apoliceman.\n","[IAN] While you nip off quietly in the other direction.\n","[DOCTOR] Insulting. There's only one way in and out of this yard. Ishall be here when you get back. I want to see your faces when you tryto explain away your behaviour to a policeman.\n","[IAN] Nevertheless, we're going to find one.

I believe these people are known to you.\n","[SUSAN] They're two of my schoolteachers. What are you doing here?\n","[BARBARA] Where are we?\n","[DOCTOR] They must have followed you. That ridiculous school. I knewsomething like this would happen if we stayed in one place too long.\n","[SUSAN] But why should they follow me?\n","[BARBARA] Is this really where you live, Susan?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] And what's wrong with it?\n","[IAN] But it was just a telephone box.\n","[DOCTOR] Perhaps.\n","[BARBARA] And this is your grandfather?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] But why didn't you tell us that?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't discuss my private life with strangers.\n","[IAN] But it was a police telephone box. I walked all around it.Barbara, you saw me.\n","[DOCTOR] You don't deserve any explanations.

This is very\n","[IAN] I walked all round it.\n","[DOCTOR] It's stopped again, you know, and I've tried hmm? Oh, youwouldn't understand.\n","[IAN] But I want to understand.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. By the way, Susan, I managed tofind a replacement for that faulty filament. It's an amateur job, but Ithink it'll serve.\n","[IAN] It's an illusion. It must be.\n","[DOCTOR] What is he talking about now?\n","[SUSAN] What are you doing here?\n","[DOCTOR] You don't understand, so you find excuses. Illusions, indeed?You say you can't fit an enormous building into one of your smallersitting rooms.\n","[IAN] No.\n","[DOCTOR] But you've discovered television, haven't you?\n","[IAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Then by showing an enormous building on your television screen,you can do what seemed impossible, couldn't you?\n","[IAN] Well, yes, but I still don't know\n","[DOCTOR] Not quite clear, is it. I can see by your face that you're notcertain. You don't understand. And I knew you wouldn't. Never mind. Nowthen, which switch was it? No. No, no. Ah yes, that is it. The point isnot whether you understand. What is going to happen to you, hmm?They'll tell everybody about the ship now.\n","[IAN] Ship?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, ship. This doesn't roll along on wheels, you know.\n","[BARBARA] You mean it moves?\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis can go anywhere.\n","[BARBARA] Tardis? I don't understand you, Susan.\n","[SUSAN] Well, I made up the name Tardis from the initials, Time AndRelative Dimension In Space. I thought you'd both understand when yousaw the different dimensions inside from those outside.\n","[IAN] Just let me get this straight. A thing that looks like a policebox, standing in a junkyard, it can move anywhere in time and space?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Quite so.\n","[IAN] But that's ridiculous.\n","[SUSAN] Why won't they believe us?\n","[BARBARA] How can we?\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, don't get exasperated, Susan. Remember the RedIndian. When he saw the first steam train, his savage mind thought itan illusion, too.\n","[IAN] You're treating us like children.\n","[DOCTOR] Am I? The children of my civilisation would be insulted.\n","[IAN] Your civilisation?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my civilisation. I tolerate this century, but I don'tenjoy it. Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in thefourth dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off fromour own planet, without friends or protection. But one day we shall getback. Yes, one day. One day.\n","[SUSAN] It's true. Every word of it's true. You don't know what you'vedone coming in here. Grandfather, let them go now, please. Look, ifthey don't understand, they can't, they can't hurt us at all. Iunderstand these people better than you. Their minds reject things theydon't understand.\n","[DOCTOR] No.\n","[IAN] He can't keep us here.\n","[BARBARA] Susan, listen to me. Can't you see that all this is anillusion? It's a game that you and your grandfather are playing, if youlike, but you can't expect us to believe it.\n","[SUSAN] It's not a game!\n","[BARBARA] But Susan, it's\n","[SUSAN] It's not! Look, I love your school. I loved England in thetwentieth century. The last five months have been the happiest of mylife.\n","[BARBARA] But you are one of us.

Oh, come on, Barbara, let's get out ofhere.\n","[SUSAN] It's no use, you can't get out. He won't let you go.\n","[IAN] He closed the doors from over there. I saw him. Now, which is it?Which is it? Which control operates the door?\n","[DOCTOR] You still think it's all an illusion?\n","[IAN] I know that free movement time and space is a scientific dream Idon't expect to find solved in a junkyard.\n","[DOCTOR] Your arrogance is nearly as great as your ignorance.\n","[IAN] Will you open the door?

Everything'ssort of white and ashen.\n","[IAN] Funny mist.\n","[DOCTOR] The heat must have been indescribable. Look at this soil here.Look at it. It's all turn to sand and ashes. Extraordinary. How canshrubs or trees grow in soil like that, hmm?\n","[IAN] Something else that's strange. There's quite a breeze blowing.\n","[SUSAN] Well?\n","[IAN] Well, look at the branches and things.\n","[SUSAN] They don't seem to be moving.\n","[BARBARA] They're not. They're absolutely still.\n","[IAN] Huh. Like stone, look. Very brittle stone. It crumbles when youtouch it. Look.\n","[DOCTOR] It's petrified. How fascinating, a petrified jungle. Hm.Extraordinary. Yes, I must really investigate that. Couldn't have beenheat, then, and age would merely decay.\n","[SUSAN] What could have caused it, Grandfather?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, I don't know, but I intend to find out.\n","[SUSAN] Well I'm coming too.\n","[BARBARA] Ian, where are we?\n","[IAN] I don't know.\n","[BARBARA] Well why doesn't he take us back?\n","[IAN] I'm not sure that he can.\n","[BARBARA] What, ever?\n","[IAN] I hate it as much as you. I'm just as afraid. But what can we do?\n","[BARBARA] Well, we could at least stay near the ship.\n","[IAN] The ship's no good without him. We'd better keep an eye on him. Heseems to have a knack of getting himself into trouble.\n","[BARBARA] You think there's any danger?\n","[IAN] Not necessarily.\n","[BARBARA] But don't be too complacent. No, you're right, I suppose. Ijust wish\n","[IAN] We'll be all right.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Well, I suppose we'd better make sure he doesn't falldown and break a leg. Don't you ever think he deserves something tohappen to him?\n","[IAN] Yes.\n","[SUSAN] Oh Grandfather, look! It's a flower. A perfect flower. Well,it's even kept some of it's colour.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, very pretty, very pretty. Hm.\n","[SUSAN] Hey, look. Look what I've found.\n","[IAN] Oh, that's beautiful.\n","[SUSAN] Isn't it? I'm going to try and pick it and keep it all in onepiece.\n","[IAN] Oh, be careful. It'll be very fragile. There we are.\n","[SUSAN] Beautiful. When I get it back to the ship I'm\n","[BARBARA] Ian!\n","[SUSAN] going to put it into a glass and\n","[BARBARA] Ian!\n","[IAN] Coming, coming.\n","[IAN] What is it? What's the matter?\n","[BARBARA] No!\n","[IAN] It's all right. Like everything else in this place, solid stone.\n","[BARBARA] It's hideous.\n","[IAN] Yes, it is. It's also significant. Nothing on Earth could looklike this.\n","[BARBARA] It looks like some sculptor's nightmare.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it's certainly alien to anything on your planet. Butyou're wrong about one thing, Chesterfield. This isn't like everythingelse. The animal is solidified, certainly, but it's not crumbly stone.It's metal. Yes, it always was.\n","[IAN] What, even when it was alive? But that's impossible.\n","[DOCTOR] Why? Can't you imagine an animal unless it's flesh, blood andbone, hmm? No, I tell you this is an entirely different formation. Ishould say originally it was some pliable metal held together by amagnetic field, or an inner magnetic field, rather, and it may have hadthe ability to attract it's victims towards it, if they were metal too.\n","[BARBARA] We're not on Earth, then.\n","[DOCTOR] No, certainly not.\n","[IAN] Are you sure?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, certain. And you needn't look at me like that, young man.We started this journey far too hurriedly to make any calculations. Youknow that as well as I do. However, we're alive.\n","[SUSAN] Hey, Grandfather, look. The jungle ends over there.\n","[IAN] Try not to be too upset.\n","[BARBARA] I counted so much on just going back to things I recognise andtrust. But here there's nothing to rely on. Nothing.\n","[IAN] Well, there's me. Barbara, all I ask you to do is believe, reallybelieve, we'll go back. We will, you know.\n","[BARBARA] I wish I was more like you. I'm afraid I'm a very unwillingadventurer.\n","[IAN] I'm not exactly reveling in it myself.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather's talking about fixing our position by the stars.\n","[IAN] Good. Where is he?\n","[SUSAN] Just over there.\n","[BARBARA] Susan. Don't you have anything in the ship that records thejourneys?\n","[SUSAN] Oh, yes. There's a meter fixed to a great big bank of computers.If you feed it with the right sort of information, it can take over thecontrols of the ship and deliver you to any place you want to go.\n","[BARBARA] Then why don't we know where we are?\n","[SUSAN] Well, it's a question of the right information, you see. I don'tsay that Grandfather doesn't know how to work the ship, but he's soforgetful, and then he will go off and. Well, he likes to work on hisown.\n","[BARBARA] So I've noticed.\n","[SUSAN] Anyway, he's only got to do some computations back in the shipand we can move on.\n","[BARBARA] Well, it can't be too soon for me.\n","[DOCTOR] Well now, are we ready?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Doctor, have you worked out yet how all this happened?\n","[DOCTOR] No, not really, not really. Whatever it was destroyedeverything that was living, but the planet is dead, totally dead.\n","[IAN] Barbara, Doctor. Over here.\n","[DOCTOR] What is it, Chesterton? We really must get back to\n","[DOCTOR] Most fascinating.\n","[BARBARA] A city, a huge city.\n","[IAN] Well, Doctor? Can you see anything? Any sign of life?\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no sign of life. No, just buildings. Magnificentbuildings, I\n","[SUSAN] Oh, let me have a look. It's fabulous. Here, you have a look.\n","[IAN] What do you think, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, I don't know. Whatever it was destroyed thevegetation here certainly hasn't damaged the city. But there's no signof life. No movement, no light, no. No, I shall know more about it whenI've been down there.\n","[BARBARA] Down there? Oh, no. We're going back to the ship.\n","[DOCTOR] Now, don't be ridiculous. That city down there is a magnificentsubject for study, and I don't intend to leave here until I'vethoroughly investigated it.\n","[IAN] Well it's too late to talk about it now. It's getting dark. We'lldiscuss it when we get back to the ship.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Whatever you decide, it's too late to get down there now.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, all right then. But I assure you I'm determinedto study that place.\n","[IAN] You can do what you like, as long as you don't endanger the restof us.\n","[DOCTOR] Very well then. I shall look at it myself, alone.\n","[IAN] You're the only one who can operate the ship. I'm afraid I can'tlet you do that, Doctor. Your glasses.\n","[IAN] I think this is the way we came.\n","[SUSAN] Who's there?\n","[IAN] All right, Susan, it's all right. You're safe now.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Tardis)\n","[BARBARA] Did Susan tell you what frightened her?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. She's convinced that someone touched her, and I triedto make her see it wasn't possible but I'm afraid she wouldn't listento me. I wonder, would you have a talk with her?\n","[BARBARA] Yes, of course I will.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you know, sometimes I find the gulf between Susan's ageand mine makes difficult understanding between us.\n","[BARBARA] I'll see what I can do.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, would you? Thank you, thank you very much. I'd be grateful.\n","[BARBARA] Hello.\n","[SUSAN] Hello.\n","[BARBARA] What are you doing?\n","[SUSAN] Just drawing.\n","[BARBARA] Well, can I see?\n","[SUSAN] It's the flower I saw in the jungle.\n","[BARBARA] What happened out there?\n","[SUSAN] Nothing.\n","[BARBARA] Well Ian said you were terrified. Well, something must havefrightened you.\n","[SUSAN] It's not that so much. It's just that I'm, I'm fed up no onebelieves me.\n","[BARBARA] Believes what?\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I don't know.\n","[BARBARA] That there was someone out there and they touched you on theshoulder?\n","[SUSAN] There was someone there.\n","[BARBARA] But you didn't see who it was?\n","[SUSAN] No. It was like that. A light touch on the shoulder. I couldn'thave been mistaken.\n","[BARBARA] Well, I believe you.\n","[SUSAN] But Grandfather says that it's impossible for anyone to live outthere.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Susan, it isn't that he doesn't believe you. It's justthat he finds it difficult to go against his scientific facts.\n","[SUSAN] I know.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, look. Why don't you just try and forget it for the moment?\n","[SUSAN] For the moment.\n","[IAN] What's this one for? I don't know how you make sense of any ofthis.\n","[DOCTOR] You're quite right, quite right.\n","[IAN] Can you find where we are? Well, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] Hmm? Oh.\n","[IAN] I was wondering if perhaps you\n","[DOCTOR] My dear boy, these eternal questions of yours. Do I know wherewe are, I suppose?\n","[IAN] Now listen, Doctor, I don't want to argue with you. We're fellowtravellers whether we like it or not. But for heaven's sake try and seeit from our point of view. You've uprooted us violently from our ownlives. You\n","[DOCTOR] You pushed your way into the ship, young man.\n","[IAN] All right, all right, I admit it. A small part of the blame isours.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, small?\n","[IAN] But naturally we're anxious. What are we going to do? Can we livehere? What do we eat? There are millions of questions.\n","[DOCTOR] A very good idea. I'm hungry.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, what's the matter?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I've suddenly got this terrible headache.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, dear, dear, how irksome for you. Oh, this stuff is verygood. This should cure it. Now, not too much, dear, not too much.\n","[SUSAN] No. Oh, Grandfather. I'm sorry I was so silly just now. Here,try this.\n","[BARBARA] Thank you. Oh, it's very nice.\n","[IAN] Let's hope it does you some good.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, did you want something to eat? What would you like?\n","[BARBARA] I'd like some bacon and eggs.\n","[IAN] All right, bacon and eggs.\n","[DOCTOR] Bacon and eggs.\n","[IAN] But\n","[SUSAN] This is fully automatic.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, certainly, certainly.

Not bad. What do you think, Barbara?\n","[BARBARA] I think it's delicious.\n","[IAN] My bacon's a bit salty.\n","[DOCTOR] It shouldn't be. It's English.\n","[IAN] No, seriously, Doctor, this is remarkable. I mean, one bite and Itaste the bacon, another and I taste the egg. How do you do it?\n","[DOCTOR] Food has component parts, dear boy. Flavours are rather likeprimary colours, you know, you blend two to achieve a third, a fourth,etc, etc.\n","[IAN] Well, I think it's wonderful.\n","[SUSAN] How's your headache now?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, it's much better. I don't usually get them at all.\n","[DOCTOR] Susan, would you like something to eat?\n","[SUSAN] No thanks, I'm not hungry.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, child, that's unusual. I do hope your affects outside theship hasn't affected you too much.\n","[SUSAN] No. I think I'll go to bed now, anyway.\n","[DOCTOR] Right.\n","[SUSAN] Do you want to know where you can sleep, Miss Wright?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, yes.\n","[IAN] What's that?\n","[DOCTOR] The scanner.\n","[SUSAN] There was somebody there.\n","[IAN] Nothing. Not a thing.\n","[SUSAN] But something must have made that noise.\n","[BARBARA] Look, I've had enough of this. Please, can't we get out ofhere?\n","[DOCTOR] Ah, but the city. I must see the city.\n","[BARBARA] But why?\n","[DOCTOR] I will not be questioned. Uninvited passengers. I didn't invitethem to the ship. I shall do what I want to do.\n","[IAN] Why endanger the rest of us by staying here?\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, please. Please.\n","[BARBARA] Stone trees are all very well, but the next forest I walkthrough I want them all to be made of wood.\n","[SUSAN] What's the matter?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know. The power take-up was rising normally and\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh don't distract me, please.\n","[SUSAN] Shall I trace it on the fault locator, Grandfather?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I think you'd better, child.\n","[SUSAN] (checking a printout) K7.\n","[DOCTOR] K7? Ah, yes, of course, the fluid link. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, there we are, you see. The end of it's unscrewed itselfand the fluid has run out.\n","[IAN] Have you got a spare?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, no, no need for that. This is easily repaired.

We haven't any at all.\n","[IAN] What?\n","[DOCTOR] No.\n","[IAN] Don't you carry a supply?\n","[DOCTOR] No, it hasn't been necessary.

There isn't anything outside because\n","[IAN] Yes. There's the city.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, the city, of course. Of course we're bound to get somemercury there. Yes, we're bound to. Well, I mean, what else can we do,hmm?\n","[IAN] It seems we have no alternative. We have to go to the city.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, indeed. At first light, then?\n","[IAN] Well, it's light enough and there doesn't seem to be anything outthere. We might as well get started. Oh, and Doctor. Remember we'regoing to this city to find mercury, and once we've found it we'recoming straight back here.

Stand back, all of you.\n","[IAN] I think it's all right. A metal box. It's a box of glass phials.Look.\n","[DOCTOR] Let me see.\n","[SUSAN] Then there was somebody here last night. They must have droppedthem. I knew I was right.\n","[IAN] Yes. Sorry, Susan.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'd like to run a few tests on those. Susan, would youtake these into the ship, please?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Thank you. Oh, and by the way, did you remember the foodsupplies?\n","[SUSAN] Yes. A day's supply for four. That's enough, isn't it?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, ample, ample.\n","[IAN] I trust we won't be more than a couple of hours. You ready, Susan?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[IAN] Come on, then.

I'll go this way. (through the door)\n","[DOCTOR] Would you lend me your arm, would you, Susan? Thank you.\n","[SUSAN] Let's try this one.

Very intelligent.\n","[IAN] Yes, but how do they use their intelligence? What form does ittake?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, as if that matters. What these instruments tell us is thatwe're in the midst of a very, very advanced civilised society.\n","[SUSAN] Here it is. The thing that's ticking. It's over here. It's aGeiger counter.\n","[IAN] But look at the needle! It's past the danger point.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, that explains a lot of things, doesn't it. A jungleturned to stone, the barren soil and the fact that we're not feelingwell.\n","[IAN] Radiation sickness?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'm afraid so. The atmosphere here is polluted with a veryhigh level of fallout, and we've been walking around in it completelyunprotected.\n","[IAN] What? But how do you explain the buildings? They're intact.\n","[DOCTOR] A neutron bomb. Yes. It destroys all human tissue, but leavesthe buildings and machinery intact. Yes.\n","[IAN] What? But how much radiation, and how badly?\n","[DOCTOR] We need, we need drugs to be treated.\n","[IAN] But where are we going to find them?\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis will have to take us to another time and place wherewe can be cured.\n","[IAN] But don't you remember? We can't move the ship until we find themercury for the fluid link!\n","[DOCTOR] For the fluid link, yes. Yes, I'm afraid I cheated a little onthat. I was determined to see the city, but everybody wanted to go onand, well, to avoid arguments, in short, there's nothing wrong with thefluid link.\n","[SUSAN] What? Grandfather, do you mean to say that you risked leavingthe ship just to see this place?\n","[IAN] You fool. You old fool!\n","[DOCTOR] Abuse me as much as you like, Chesterton.

As far as I can ascertain,the creatures out there are the ones who dropped the box. They'recalled Thals. They're mutations.\n","[IAN] So it wasn't our captors who left the drugs behind?\n","[DOCTOR] No. If they were drugs. I've learnt quite a lot from theDaleks.\n","[IAN] The who?\n","[DOCTOR] The Daleks, our captors here. Oh, if I didn't feel so. Oh. ButI was right about the neutron bomb.

But do they live in thatdead city?\n","[SUSAN] Well, underneath it, anyway. You see, the Daleks want the drugstoo, and they won't let us go until I bring them back to them.\n","[ALYDON] But why should they want the drugs? Surely they must have somethemselves if they're still alive.\n","[SUSAN] I don't know. Look, my grandfather and my friends are terriblyill. I must take the drug back to them.\n","[ALYDON] No. No, no, wait.

It just means the drug'sworking, that's all.\n","[IAN] This Alydon of yours seems to have kept his wits about him. Givingyou that extra supply of drugs.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. It was strange when the Daleks found it. I thought first ofall they were going to keep both lots. Then they suddenly seemed tochange their mind and gave the second lot back to me.\n","[IAN] Yes. Still, the Thals seem more friendly.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, yes. Alydon gave me this cloak to keep me warm.\n","[BARBARA] Why do the Daleks think they're mutations?\n","[SUSAN] I don't know.

Alydon says the Thals aregoing to starve unless they can find new supplies of food. You see,after the war, the Thals that survived managed to cultivate small plotsof land. Well, that's how they've survived ever since. But they'vealways had to be very, very careful, because the crops have always beenin danger. But, you see, they rely on a great rainfall that onlyhappens about every four or five years. Well, it's two years overduenow, and all their crops are ruined.

No. I feelpreserving our prisoners was a good idea.\n","[DALEK 2] And an arrangement to bring the Thals inside our city an evenbetter one.\n","[DALEK 1] We'll let our prisoners sleep and then give them food.

The once famous warrior race of Thals are now farmers.\n","[DYONI] But the Daleks were teachers, weren't they, Temmosus?\n","[TEMMOSUS] Yes, they were. And philosophers.\n","[GANATUS] Perhaps they are the warriors now.\n","[TEMMOSUS] From the distance, the city looks as if they make science andinvention their profession. It's a magical architecture.

If Iknew that, I, I could alter our approach to them, perhaps.\n","[IAN] Your leader, Temmosus.\n","[ALYDON] Yes?\n","[IAN] Well, he appealed very sensibly to them. Any reasonable humanbeings would have responded to him. The Daleks didn't. They obviouslythink and act and feel in an entirely different way. They just aren'thuman.\n","[GANATUS] Yes, but why destroy without any apparent thought or reason?That's what I don't understand.\n","[IAN] Oh, there's a reason. Explanation might be better. It's stupid andridiculous, but it's the only one that fits.\n","[ALYDON] What?\n","[IAN] A dislike for the unlike.\n","[ALYDON] I don't follow you.\n","[IAN] They're afraid of you because you're different from them.

The lake is alivewith mutations, bred and crossbred until the original has long beenreplaced by. I'm sorry, I'm being morbid.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I don't mind as long as we're this far away. But I wonderwhy the Daleks haven't cleaned it out? Killed everything?\n","[GANATUS] Why should they? Isn't it the perfect defence for the back ofa city? Only a fool would attack the city from the lake.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Control room)\n","[DALEK 2] Has the anti-radiation drug distribution been stopped?\n","[DALEK 3] Yes. Only Daleks in section two and three received it. AllDaleks in section three have now died.\n","[DALEK 2] Daleks in section two are to be brought to the sonic chamber.\n","[DALEK 3] We will direct the air polluted by radiation away from thenuclear reactors into the sonic chamber.\n","[DALEK 2] And if they do not die, we shall have our answer.\n","[DALEK 3] But if we need radiation, we can never rebuild the worldoutside.\n","[DALEK 1] We do not have to adapt to the environment.

If wedo not help you, what will you do?\n","[IAN] We'll find our way into the city, and take back our lostequipment.\n","[ALYDON] You see, we cannot stand by and let these people die. If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die. But there is a terrible shame inbeing afraid to live. If none of you agree with my reasons, then let mego with these people, and I will help you elect a new chief.\n","[GANATUS] I'll go with you, Alydon.\n","[THAL] And I.\n","[THAL 2] Let's start at once.\n","[ANTODUS] And I.\n","[IAN] Thank you.\n","[ALYDON] You knew what my decision would be.\n","[GANATUS] I could always have destroyed it if you'd decided differently.\n","[DOCTOR] If we get this intelligent anticipation, we shall succeed.Let's see this. Now, what is this area here?\n","[GANATUS] The swamp. Here are the mountains. This is the far side of thecity. I've been into the swamp. It's surrounded by lakes, here, as yousee. The lakes are inhabited by all sorts of strange creatures.\n","[IAN] Can we get into the city this way?\n","[ALYDON] Over the mountains?\n","[IAN] Yes.\n","[GANATUS] That means going through that swamp.\n","[ALYDON] We can't go through the swamp. It's too dangerous.\n","[GANATUS] It is dangerous, yes, but I realised last night when I wastalking to Barbara that it is undefended.\n","[ALYDON] Undefended? It's a perfect natural barrier. All thosecreatures, you know that yourself.\n","[GANATUS] Yes, I know, but I mean the Daleks won't be on guard there.There's a chance to take them by surprise. Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\n","[ALYDON] Yes. Very well then. That is what we must do.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Control room)\n","[DALEK 2] The laser scope is transmitting. Thequality is poor. What has happened?

Except for one serious case, allDaleks in section two have shown signs of recovery.\n","[DALEK 2] Then our position is clear. For us, the drug is a poison.\n","[DALEK 1] And radiation is still necessary to us.\n","[DALEK 2] Essential. I want a complete survey of our stock of nuclearmaterials.

It's your duty to tell them. How we watchedAmezus dragged beneath the waters of the lake, while you and I ran interror when\n","[GANATUS] That's enough. We're going on, Antodus. You keep your fears toyourself. I don't want you upsetting the others. Is that clear?\n","[ANTODUS] Yes.\n","[GANATUS] Well, is it?\n","[ANTODUS] Yes!\n","[GANATUS] Well, this is the swamp. From now on it's going to be ratheruncomfortable.\n","[IAN] Yes, I see what you mean.\n","[GANATUS] The ground's very uneven. Sometimes rock, sometimes thick mud.You'll have to watch how you walk. I think it'll be a wise plan to finda place to rest for the night.\n","[IAN] Yes. We've made very good time. It's only taken four hours to gethere from the edge of the forest. That leaves us with two and a halfdays to go through the mountains to the city.\n","[GANATUS] If there is a way through.\n","[IAN] We'll find a way. I'll go and give Barbara a hand.\n","[GANATUS] I'm surprised you let her come.\n","[IAN] I'd be more surprised if I could have stopped her. How are youdoing?\n","[BARBARA] Fine. Oh, I'm glad the mountaineering's over.\n","[IAN] There'll be some more once we get through this little lot.\n","[BARBARA] We're going through there?\n","[IAN] Well, we must. We've got a deadline with the Doctor in two and ahalf days, and we've got to make it.\n","[BARBARA] Well I think we could all do with a rest.\n","[IAN] No, we'll keep up with the others. They'll be breaking camp soon.Now take care. Watch where you put your feet. All right?\n","[GANATUS] This looks like a fairly dry section.\n","[IAN] Yes, this'll do.\n","[GANATUS] Right, we'll make camp here. See if we can gather up some drybranches.\n","[IAN] All right.\n","[GANATUS] It'll make it more comfortable to sleep on. Barbara, you seeto the food. I'll get the fire going.\n","[BARBARA] Right.\n","[GANATUS] At least it might stop some of these, these things frombothering us.\n","[BARBARA] What was it?

We're more used to this kind of life. It's overa year since we left our own plateau in search of a new source of food.I'd almost forgotten what it was like to stay in one place and enjoyit.

I'll come with you. Morning.\n","[BARBARA] Morning. Oh, for a feather pillow and a spring mattress.\n","[GANATUS] What did you see?\n","[ELYON] Over there.\n","[IAN] We were right. The Daleks do get their water from the lake.\n","[GANATUS] But how would it get to the city from there?\n","[IAN] Well, there must be a way. I mean, the Daleks aren't very mobile.They must have cut a pathway through there to work on the pipeline.\n","[GANATUS] How long do you think it will take us to reach there?\n","[ELYON] Most of today. If we could cross the lake we could reach it muchquicker.\n","[IAN] I'm sorry, that's one way I'm not going.\n","[ELYON] Well, it would be dangerous, certainly. The lake is full ofmutations.\n","[GANATUS] No, we must go round.\n","[IAN] Yes, and we ought to try and get there before the sun goes down.\n","[ELYON] Well I'll just go and fill the water bags. (a little away fromIan) There's no point in trying to cross the lake, you think?\n","[GANATUS] No. No, he's right. Anyway, think how long it would take tobuild a light raft.\n","[IAN] Barbara, we saw some pipes going into the lake.\n","[BARBARA] So we can go through?\n","[IAN] Maybe. With a bit of luck, eh?

She's trying to poison your mindagainst me.\n","[IAN] (suddenly sitting up) Don't touch it, Doctor! (and falling backagain)\n","[SUSAN] I do believe you. Grandfather, they couldn't have done all thethings that happened.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes, I admit they were very smart.\n","[SUSAN] No, it's not a question of being smart.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you see I wouldn't allow them to hurt you, child? They'revery resourceful and cunning, and it only leaves me one recourse. Theymust be put off the ship.\n","[SUSAN] No! You can't do that!\n","[DOCTOR] I can and I must.\n","[BARBARA] But you can't open the doors.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't underestimate my powers, young lady.\n","[SUSAN] Look, Grandfather. You've no means of telling what's out there.There may be no air, it may be freezing, it may be too hot to exist.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, or it might be the Earth in the twentieth century. Hadn'tit occurred to you? My ship is very valuable, remember?\n","[BARBARA] Why are you so suspicious of us?\n","[DOCTOR] Put yourself in my place, young lady, and you'd do preciselythe same thing, wouldn't you? Hmm?\n","[IAN] What are you two saying to each other?\n","[DOCTOR] You're getting off the ship, Chesterton.\n","[IAN] Now?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Now. Get up.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] I'll be all right when I get outside.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, Grandfather. He doesn't know what's happening. I won't letyou do this.\n","[DOCTOR] If, of course, they'd like to confess to me what they have doneto my ship, I may even change my mind.\n","[BARBARA] What, what was that?\n","[SUSAN] The danger signal.\n","[DOCTOR] The fault locator! The whole of it!\n","[IAN] Oh, don't touch it, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[IAN] No. No, you'll get knocked out.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Ian.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, tell me.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[DOCTOR] The whole area of the fault locator has just given us awarning.\n","[SUSAN] But everything can't be. Everything can't be wrong!\n","[DOCTOR] That's what it means, child.\n","[BARBARA] No! Ian! Ian, it's all right. It's, it's all right. It's allright.\n","[IAN] I pulled you away. The controls are alive. (passes out)\n","[DOCTOR] No, you mustn't be frightened of me. Not now, please. I can'texplain, but I've just realised the danger we're in.\n","[SUSAN] It went off again, Grandfather.\n","[DOCTOR] Hurry. Look. We must pull him round. You see that panel upthere? You've heard me refer to it? The fault locator?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] If one small piece of apparatus fails, a little bulbilluminates and tells me precisely where the fault is. Can you imaginewhat would happen if the whole of it lights up? Hmm? It means that theship is on the point of disintegration. You're not to blame. All fourof us are to blame!\n","[IAN] Oh, you're all right. That drink you gave us.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, a mere harmless sleeping drug.\n","[IAN] I thought so.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you rather suspected I was up to some mischief.\n","[IAN] Yes. And I told you not to go near the control column. I told youyou'll electrocute yourself.\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid I must have misjudged you both.\n","[SUSAN] Fifteen seconds. It's happening every fifteen seconds.\n","[BARBARA] But all the clock are\n","[SUSAN] I counted.\n","[DOCTOR] Well please go on counting. Now both of you listen. Can youconcentrate?\n","[IAN] Yes, I think I'm all right.\n","[DOCTOR] We're on the brink of destruction, so all four of us must workclosely together. We must find out where we are and what is happeningto my ship.\n","[IAN] Just a moment. Why did you say that, the brink of destruction?\n","[DOCTOR] There's a strong force at work somewhere, which is threateningmy ship. It's so strong that every piece of equipment can be out ofaction at the same time.\n","[IAN] What? Total disintegration?\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. We haven't crash-landed, otherwise I would havediscovered that immediately. And I don't believe there's an evilintelligence in the ship. Just at the same token, I don't reallybelieve that you, either of you, have been the cause of this trouble.\n","[IAN] Well, what is, then?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, but we must find out.\n","[IAN] Yes, but how long have we got?\n","[SUSAN] It's definitely every quarter of a minute.\n","[IAN] Well what does that prove?\n","[BARBARA] That we have a measure of time as long as it lasts. Yes, ofcourse. That explains the clock face. We had time taken away from us,and now it's being given back to us because it's running out.\n","[SUSAN] The column.\n","[DOCTOR] But, it's impossible.\n","[IAN] Doctor, I thought it only moved when the power was on.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. The heart of the machine is under the column.\n","[IAN] Well what made it move?\n","[DOCTOR] The source of power. You see, when the column rises, it provesthe extent of the power thrust.\n","[BARBARA] Then what would have happened if the column had come outcompletely?\n","[SUSAN] Well, the power would be free to escape.\n","[DOCTOR] Can it be possible then, that this is the end?\n","[IAN] The end? What are you talking about?\n","[DOCTOR] We have ten minutes to survive.\n","[BARBARA] Ten minutes? As little as that?\n","[DOCTOR] Maybe less.\n","[IAN] Be careful, Doctor.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's quite safe here. This is where I stood when I triedthe scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Yes. Why is that part safe?\n","[SUSAN] We'll never stop it in time!\n","[BARBARA] Don't, Susan. Please don't.\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know even where to begin, Chesterton. If only I had aclue.\n","[BARBARA] I think. I think, perhaps, we've been given nothing else butclues.\n","[IAN] Have we? Like the food machine, you mean.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] It registered empty, but it wasn't.\n","[BARBARA] But the clock is the most important. It made us aware of time.\n","[SUSAN] By taking time away from us.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. And it replaced time by the light on the fault locator.\n","[IAN] Yes, it did.\n","[DOCTOR] It? It? What do you mean? My machine can't think.\n","[BARBARA] You say it has a built-in defence mechanism?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it has.\n","[BARBARA] Well that's where we've been wrong. Originally, the machinewasn't at fault, we were. And it's been trying to tell us so eversince.\n","[IAN] A machine that can think for itself?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] Is that feasible, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, think not as you or I do, but it must be able to think as amachine. You see, it has a bank of computers.\n","[BARBARA] You say the power is under this column?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] And the column holds it down.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] Well, then, what would make it want to escape?\n","[DOCTOR] I've been racking my brains. I don't know.\n","[IAN] Something outside?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, possible.\n","[IAN] A magnetic force?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, it would have to be a gigantic one. A one as strong as asolar system.\n","[BARBARA] You see? The machine's been warning us all along. All thoseblackouts we had.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. But only if anybody went near the control column.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] But it could be the power escaping.\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, it couldn't. If you felt the power, dear boy, youwouldn't live to speak of it. You'd be blown to atoms in a splitsecond.\n","[SUSAN] Besides, it's the part of it that's safe.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. The scanner. I wonder.\n","[DOCTOR] We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.\n","[DOCTOR] Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again,I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you seeoutside, understand?\n","[DOCTOR] I lied, deliberately, so that they won't know.\n","[IAN] Won't know what?\n","[DOCTOR] We have five minutes only. When the end does come, they won'tknow anything about it.\n","[IAN] There's no hope, then.\n","[DOCTOR] I can't see any. Will you face it with me?\n","[SUSAN] What are you two talking about?\n","[IAN] Oh, just a theory of mine that didn't work.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we must solve this problem, you know. We must.\n","[SUSAN] There's nothing there. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing but space.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Susan.\n","[IAN] Barbara could be right, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] I am right. I know I am. Whenever there's a good picture, thedoors open because it's safe for us to go outside. And then it shows usa terrible picture and the doors close again.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, then we have the sequence. A planet, a planet in the solarsystem, getting further away. Blinding flash. Destruction. Yes, ofcourse. It's our journey.\n","[BARBARA] And the ship refused to destroy itself.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Yes!\n","[BARBARA] The defence mechanism stopped the ship, and it's been tryingto tell us so ever since!\n","[DOCTOR] Of course. Of course!\n","[DOCTOR] I know. I know. I said it would take the force of a total solarsystem to attract the power away from my ship. We're at the verybeginning, the new start of a solar system. Outside, the atoms arerushing towards each other. Fusing, coagulating, until minute littlecollections of matter are created. And so the process goes on, and onuntil dust is formed. Dust then becomes solid entity. A new birth, of asun and its planets.\n","[IAN] But, Doctor, where are we? When we left the planet Skaro, wheredid you ask the machine to take us to? Think, Doctor!\n","[DOCTOR] I, er, had hoped to reach your planet Earth. Skaro was in thefuture and I used the fast return switch.\n","[IAN] The fast return switch? You've sent us back too far. Doctor, showme. Show me that switch. Where is it?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, I can't very well see it without a light, can I?\n","[SUSAN] It's near the scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Really? But that's the part of the control that's safe.\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Strange.\n","[IAN] Doctor, we haven't got very much time left.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I see. Here it is. (pulls a small torch from his pocket)Here, you see? Now, look, there's the switch. You see?\n","[IAN] Yes, well how does it work?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, you merely press it down, and. It's stuck. It hasn'treleased itself!\n","[IAN] What? You mean it's been on all this time?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it must have been.\n","[IAN] Well, come on, Doctor. Let's get it unstuck.\n","[DOCTOR] Hold that. Yes, just a minute now. Yes, there you are, you see?\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\n","[DOCTOR] The spring's not connecting. It's come off the base.\n","[IAN] Hurry, Doctor, hurry.\n","[DOCTOR] There we are. Take it out. Now, luckily we can turn it over andnow it should work. There. Ah, that's all right.\n","[SUSAN] We're safe now.\n","[BARBARA] Are you sure?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we can all relax. We're quite safe now. But it was anarrow squeak.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my child?\n","[SUSAN] What happened?\n","[DOCTOR] What happened? It was the switch. It was still in place. Yousee, there's a little spring inside it and it was stuck. It hadn'treleased itself.\n","[SUSAN] But why didn't the fault locator tell us?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, the switch hadn't broken down, therefore the faultlocator couldn't give us any recognition. You see, let me give you ademonstration. (using his torch) Now, look, when I put my thumb onthere, the light comes on. And it only stays on so long as my thumb ispressing that switch. As soon as I take if off, a little spring insidereleases the switch here and out goes the light.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I see. So if the spring were broken, it would be as if yourfinger were pressing it down all the time.\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. As simple as that. You know, my dear child, I thinkyour old grandfather is going a tiny little bit around the bend. Well,I think you were very brave and I was proud of you.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather? What about them? You said some terrible things tothem. When I thought he was going to attack you, even I was againsthim.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I, I, er, well\n","[IAN] Don't bother to say anything, Doctor. You know there are timeswhen I can read every thought on your face.\n","[DOCTOR] Really? And I always thought that you were a young man withoutany recrimination in you. Well, as for you, young lady, well, you wereabsolutely right. It was your instinct and intuition against my logic,and you succeeded. I mean, the blackouts, and the still pictures andthe clock. Well, you read a story into all these things and weredetermined to hold on to it. We all owe you our lives.\n","[BARBARA] I, I\n","[DOCTOR] You know, I really believe I have underestimated that younglady in the past, Chartow. Well now, we can all start again, eh? Yes,we can. Yes. But which? Hmm? What are you laughing at, dear boy? Oh,really, you are\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Room)\n","[DOCTOR] I'd like to talk to you, if I may. We've landed on a planet andthe air is good, but it's rather cold outside.\n","[BARBARA] Susan told me.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you haven't forgiven me, have you.\n","[BARBARA] You said terrible things to us.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I suppose it's the injustice that's upsetting you, andwhen I made a threat to put you off the ship it must have affected youvery deeply.\n","[BARBARA] What do you care what I think or feel?\n","[DOCTOR] As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves.\n","[BARBARA] Perhaps.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes. Because I accused you unjustly, you were determined toprove me wrong. So, you put your mind to the problem and, luckily, yousolved it.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, we're going out now.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, please, yes.

We were trying to convincethem that it was a necessity for their own survival.\n","[DOCTOR] But our fate doesn't rest with the Thals, surely. Let's leavewell alone. We have ourselves to worry about.

There's horror down there in the swamp. Five of us wentthere in search of food, and only my brother and I came back.\n","[BARBARA] What happened to the others?\n","[GANATUS] Well, we found what was left of one of them. The lake is alivewith mutations, bred and crossbred until the original has long beenreplaced by. I'm sorry, I'm being morbid.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I don't mind as long as we're this far away.

If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die. But there is a terrible shame inbeing afraid to live. If none of you agree with my reasons, then let mego with these people, and I will help you elect a new chief.\n","[GANATUS] I'll go with you, Alydon.\n","[THAL] And I.\n","[THAL 2] Let's start at once.\n","[ANTODUS] And I.\n","[IAN] Thank you.\n","[ALYDON] You knew what my decision would be.\n","[GANATUS] I could always have destroyed it if you'd decided differently.\n","[DOCTOR] If we get this intelligent anticipation, we shall succeed.Let's see this. Now, what is this area here?\n","[GANATUS] The swamp. Here are the mountains. This is the far side of thecity. I've been into the swamp. It's surrounded by lakes, here, as yousee. The lakes are inhabited by all sorts of strange creatures.\n","[IAN] Can we get into the city this way?\n","[ALYDON] Over the mountains?\n","[IAN] Yes.\n","[GANATUS] That means going through that swamp.\n","[ALYDON] We can't go through the swamp.

All thosecreatures, you know that yourself.\n","[GANATUS] Yes, I know, but I mean the Daleks won't be on guard there.There's a chance to take them by surprise. Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\n","[ALYDON] Yes. Very well then. That is what we must do.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Control room)\n","[DALEK 2] The laser scope is transmitting. Thequality is poor. What has happened?

Oh, I'm glad the mountaineering's over.\n","[IAN] There'll be some more once we get through this little lot.\n","[BARBARA] We're going through there?\n","[IAN] Well, we must.

The Daleks do get their water from the lake.\n","[GANATUS] But how would it get to the city from there?\n","[IAN] Well, there must be a way. I mean, the Daleks aren't very mobile.They must have cut a pathway through there to work on the pipeline.\n","[GANATUS] How long do you think it will take us to reach there?\n","[ELYON] Most of today. If we could cross the lake we could reach it muchquicker.\n","[IAN] I'm sorry, that's one way I'm not going.\n","[ELYON] Well, it would be dangerous, certainly.

I thought I did.\n","[SUSAN] Hey, look.\n","[IAN] Well, what's all that about?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, don't you know? I thought you might be able to explain it.\n","[IAN] Why me?\n","[DOCTOR] Trying to confuse me, eh?\n","[IAN] What are you getting at?\n","[BARBARA] Look, why don't we just try and open the doors and see forourselves what's outside?\n","[DOCTOR] What is inside, madam, is most important at the moment.\n","[BARBARA] Inside?\n","[IAN] But you've just been telling us that the only people inside areourselves.\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. I know now who's responsible. You are. You sabotagedmy ship.\n","[BARBARA] We didn't even touch your ship.\n","[IAN] (overlapping) What are you talking about?\n","[DOCTOR] You're the cause of this disaster.

You attacked us.\n","[IAN] Absolute nonsense.\n","[DOCTOR] And when we were lying helpless on the floor, you tampered withmy controls.\n","[IAN] But you checked everything yourself and you couldn't find anythingwrong with it.\n","[DOCTOR] No, sir. We checked everything. You and I.\n","[BARBARA] But why would we? For what reason?\n","[DOCTOR] Blackmail, that's why. You tried to force me to return you toEngland.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, don't be so stupid.\n","[DOCTOR] I know it. I'm sure of it.\n","[BARBARA] How dare you! Do you realise, you stupid old man, that you'dhave died in the Cave of Skulls if Ian hadn't made fire for you?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, I\n","[BARBARA] And what about what we went through against the Daleks? Notjust for us, but for you and Susan too. And all because you tricked usinto going down to the city.\n","[DOCTOR] But I, I\n","[BARBARA] Accuse us? You ought to go down on your hands and knees andthank us. But gratitude's the last thing you'll ever have, or any sortof common sense either.\n","[IAN] You can't blame us for this, Doctor. Where is he?\n","[DOCTOR] I've decided we need more time to think. We're all somewhatoverwrought. Mister Chesterton.

And Icertainly don't underestimate the dangers, if they exist. But I musthave time to think. I must think.

For good or for evil?\n","[DOCTOR] One man's law is another man's crime.

You saw him. You saw what he tried to do.\n","[BARBARA] But now he's fainted just like Susan did.\n","[DOCTOR] Susan didn't faint. It was you that told me she fainted and Ivery nearly believed you.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, what does it matter?\n","[DOCTOR] Matter? Matter, young lady? He very nearly tried to strangleme.\n","[BARBARA] But he has fainted. Look at him.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, he's play-acting.\n","[BARBARA] No, he isn't. Oh, Doctor, don't you see? Something terrible'shappening to all of us.\n","[DOCTOR] Not to me. Nothing's happened to me.

Why don't you?\n","[BARBARA] Susan!\n","[SUSAN] You've been behaving very strangely. Both of you.\n","[BARBARA] But.\n","[SUSAN] I think you're right, Grandfather.\n","[BARBARA] But you're wrong. I swear we haven't done anything.\n","[DOCTOR] I told you i'd treat you as enemies.\n","[SUSAN] No!\n","[DOCTOR] There's no other way.\n","[BARBARA] Well what are you going to do?\n","[DOCTOR] That is my business.\n","[BARBARA] Ian, wake up.

Your little trick endangered our lives.\n","[SUSAN] How did he get like this?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's all a charade.\n","[BARBARA] He went near the control panel.\n","[SUSAN] It did happen to me, Grandfather.\n","[BARBARA] Yes, you remember. You lost your memory. And there was thisterrible pain at the back of your neck.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Yes, that's true.\n","[BARBARA] What do you think we've done? Hypnotised you? Drugged you?Susan, we wouldn't do anything like that. Believe me.\n","[DOCTOR] I see. Divide and conquer, eh? She's trying to poison your mindagainst me.\n","[IAN] (suddenly sitting up) Don't touch it, Doctor! (and falling backagain)\n","[SUSAN] I do believe you. Grandfather, they couldn't have done all thethings that happened.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes, I admit they were very smart.\n","[SUSAN] No, it's not a question of being smart.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you see I wouldn't allow them to hurt you, child? They'revery resourceful and cunning, and it only leaves me one recourse. Theymust be put off the ship.\n","[SUSAN] No! You can't do that!\n","[DOCTOR] I can and I must.\n","[BARBARA] But you can't open the doors.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't underestimate my powers, young lady.\n","[SUSAN] Look, Grandfather. You've no means of telling what's out there.There may be no air, it may be freezing, it may be too hot to exist.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, or it might be the Earth in the twentieth century. Hadn'tit occurred to you? My ship is very valuable, remember?\n","[BARBARA] Why are you so suspicious of us?\n","[DOCTOR] Put yourself in my place, young lady, and you'd do preciselythe same thing, wouldn't you? Hmm?\n","[IAN] What are you two saying to each other?\n","[DOCTOR] You're getting off the ship, Chesterton.\n","[IAN] Now?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Now. Get up.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] I'll be all right when I get outside.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, Grandfather. He doesn't know what's happening. I won't letyou do this.\n","[DOCTOR] If, of course, they'd like to confess to me what they have doneto my ship, I may even change my mind.\n","[BARBARA] What, what was that?\n","[SUSAN] The danger signal.\n","[DOCTOR] The fault locator! The whole of it!\n","[IAN] Oh, don't touch it, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[IAN] No. No, you'll get knocked out.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Ian.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, tell me.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[DOCTOR] The whole area of the fault locator has just given us awarning.\n","[SUSAN] But everything can't be. Everything can't be wrong!\n","[DOCTOR] That's what it means, child.\n","[BARBARA] No! Ian! Ian, it's all right. It's, it's all right. It's allright.\n","[IAN] I pulled you away. The controls are alive. (passes out)\n","[DOCTOR] No, you mustn't be frightened of me. Not now, please. I can'texplain, but I've just realised the danger we're in.\n","[SUSAN] It went off again, Grandfather.\n","[DOCTOR] Hurry. Look. We must pull him round. You see that panel upthere? You've heard me refer to it? The fault locator?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] If one small piece of apparatus fails, a little bulbilluminates and tells me precisely where the fault is. Can you imaginewhat would happen if the whole of it lights up? Hmm? It means that theship is on the point of disintegration. You're not to blame. All fourof us are to blame!\n","[IAN] Oh, you're all right. That drink you gave us.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, a mere harmless sleeping drug.\n","[IAN] I thought so.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you rather suspected I was up to some mischief.\n","[IAN] Yes. And I told you not to go near the control column. I told youyou'll electrocute yourself.\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid I must have misjudged you both.\n","[SUSAN] Fifteen seconds. It's happening every fifteen seconds.\n","[BARBARA] But all the clock are\n","[SUSAN] I counted.\n","[DOCTOR] Well please go on counting. Now both of you listen. Can youconcentrate?\n","[IAN] Yes, I think I'm all right.\n","[DOCTOR] We're on the brink of destruction, so all four of us must workclosely together. We must find out where we are and what is happeningto my ship.\n","[IAN] Just a moment. Why did you say that, the brink of destruction?\n","[DOCTOR] There's a strong force at work somewhere, which is threateningmy ship. It's so strong that every piece of equipment can be out ofaction at the same time.\n","[IAN] What? Total disintegration?\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. We haven't crash-landed, otherwise I would havediscovered that immediately. And I don't believe there's an evilintelligence in the ship. Just at the same token, I don't reallybelieve that you, either of you, have been the cause of this trouble.\n","[IAN] Well, what is, then?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, but we must find out.\n","[IAN] Yes, but how long have we got?\n","[SUSAN] It's definitely every quarter of a minute.\n","[IAN] Well what does that prove?\n","[BARBARA] That we have a measure of time as long as it lasts. Yes, ofcourse. That explains the clock face. We had time taken away from us,and now it's being given back to us because it's running out.\n","[SUSAN] The column.\n","[DOCTOR] But, it's impossible.\n","[IAN] Doctor, I thought it only moved when the power was on.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. The heart of the machine is under the column.\n","[IAN] Well what made it move?\n","[DOCTOR] The source of power. You see, when the column rises, it provesthe extent of the power thrust.\n","[BARBARA] Then what would have happened if the column had come outcompletely?\n","[SUSAN] Well, the power would be free to escape.\n","[DOCTOR] Can it be possible then, that this is the end?\n","[IAN] The end? What are you talking about?\n","[DOCTOR] We have ten minutes to survive.\n","[BARBARA] Ten minutes? As little as that?\n","[DOCTOR] Maybe less.\n","[IAN] Be careful, Doctor.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's quite safe here. This is where I stood when I triedthe scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Yes. Why is that part safe?\n","[SUSAN] We'll never stop it in time!\n","[BARBARA] Don't, Susan. Please don't.\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know even where to begin, Chesterton. If only I had aclue.\n","[BARBARA] I think. I think, perhaps, we've been given nothing else butclues.\n","[IAN] Have we? Like the food machine, you mean.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] It registered empty, but it wasn't.\n","[BARBARA] But the clock is the most important. It made us aware of time.\n","[SUSAN] By taking time away from us.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. And it replaced time by the light on the fault locator.\n","[IAN] Yes, it did.\n","[DOCTOR] It? It? What do you mean? My machine can't think.\n","[BARBARA] You say it has a built-in defence mechanism?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it has.\n","[BARBARA] Well that's where we've been wrong. Originally, the machinewasn't at fault, we were. And it's been trying to tell us so eversince.\n","[IAN] A machine that can think for itself?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] Is that feasible, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, think not as you or I do, but it must be able to think as amachine. You see, it has a bank of computers.\n","[BARBARA] You say the power is under this column?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] And the column holds it down.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] Well, then, what would make it want to escape?\n","[DOCTOR] I've been racking my brains. I don't know.\n","[IAN] Something outside?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, possible.\n","[IAN] A magnetic force?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, it would have to be a gigantic one. A one as strong as asolar system.\n","[BARBARA] You see? The machine's been warning us all along. All thoseblackouts we had.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. But only if anybody went near the control column.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] But it could be the power escaping.\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, it couldn't. If you felt the power, dear boy, youwouldn't live to speak of it. You'd be blown to atoms in a splitsecond.\n","[SUSAN] Besides, it's the part of it that's safe.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. The scanner. I wonder.\n","[DOCTOR] We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.\n","[DOCTOR] Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again,I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you seeoutside, understand?\n","[DOCTOR] I lied, deliberately, so that they won't know.\n","[IAN] Won't know what?\n","[DOCTOR] We have five minutes only. When the end does come, they won'tknow anything about it.\n","[IAN] There's no hope, then.\n","[DOCTOR] I can't see any. Will you face it with me?\n","[SUSAN] What are you two talking about?\n","[IAN] Oh, just a theory of mine that didn't work.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we must solve this problem, you know. We must.\n","[SUSAN] There's nothing there. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing but space.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Susan.\n","[IAN] Barbara could be right, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] I am right. I know I am. Whenever there's a good picture, thedoors open because it's safe for us to go outside. And then it shows usa terrible picture and the doors close again.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, then we have the sequence. A planet, a planet in the solarsystem, getting further away. Blinding flash. Destruction. Yes, ofcourse. It's our journey.\n","[BARBARA] And the ship refused to destroy itself.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Yes!\n","[BARBARA] The defence mechanism stopped the ship, and it's been tryingto tell us so ever since!\n","[DOCTOR] Of course. Of course!\n","[DOCTOR] I know. I know. I said it would take the force of a total solarsystem to attract the power away from my ship. We're at the verybeginning, the new start of a solar system. Outside, the atoms arerushing towards each other. Fusing, coagulating, until minute littlecollections of matter are created. And so the process goes on, and onuntil dust is formed. Dust then becomes solid entity. A new birth, of asun and its planets.\n","[IAN] But, Doctor, where are we? When we left the planet Skaro, wheredid you ask the machine to take us to? Think, Doctor!\n","[DOCTOR] I, er, had hoped to reach your planet Earth. Skaro was in thefuture and I used the fast return switch.\n","[IAN] The fast return switch? You've sent us back too far. Doctor, showme. Show me that switch. Where is it?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, I can't very well see it without a light, can I?\n","[SUSAN] It's near the scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Really? But that's the part of the control that's safe.\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Strange.\n","[IAN] Doctor, we haven't got very much time left.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I see. Here it is. (pulls a small torch from his pocket)Here, you see? Now, look, there's the switch. You see?\n","[IAN] Yes, well how does it work?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, you merely press it down, and. It's stuck. It hasn'treleased itself!\n","[IAN] What? You mean it's been on all this time?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it must have been.\n","[IAN] Well, come on, Doctor. Let's get it unstuck.\n","[DOCTOR] Hold that. Yes, just a minute now. Yes, there you are, you see?\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\n","[DOCTOR] The spring's not connecting. It's come off the base.\n","[IAN] Hurry, Doctor, hurry.\n","[DOCTOR] There we are. Take it out. Now, luckily we can turn it over andnow it should work. There. Ah, that's all right.\n","[SUSAN] We're safe now.\n","[BARBARA] Are you sure?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we can all relax. We're quite safe now. But it was anarrow squeak.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my child?\n","[SUSAN] What happened?\n","[DOCTOR] What happened? It was the switch. It was still in place. Yousee, there's a little spring inside it and it was stuck. It hadn'treleased itself.\n","[SUSAN] But why didn't the fault locator tell us?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, the switch hadn't broken down, therefore the faultlocator couldn't give us any recognition. You see, let me give you ademonstration. (using his torch) Now, look, when I put my thumb onthere, the light comes on. And it only stays on so long as my thumb ispressing that switch. As soon as I take if off, a little spring insidereleases the switch here and out goes the light.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I see. So if the spring were broken, it would be as if yourfinger were pressing it down all the time.\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. As simple as that. You know, my dear child, I thinkyour old grandfather is going a tiny little bit around the bend. Well,I think you were very brave and I was proud of you.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather? What about them? You said some terrible things tothem. When I thought he was going to attack you, even I was againsthim.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I, I, er, well\n","[IAN] Don't bother to say anything, Doctor. You know there are timeswhen I can read every thought on your face.\n","[DOCTOR] Really? And I always thought that you were a young man withoutany recrimination in you. Well, as for you, young lady, well, you wereabsolutely right. It was your instinct and intuition against my logic,and you succeeded. I mean, the blackouts, and the still pictures andthe clock. Well, you read a story into all these things and weredetermined to hold on to it. We all owe you our lives.\n","[BARBARA] I, I\n","[DOCTOR] You know, I really believe I have underestimated that younglady in the past, Chartow. Well now, we can all start again, eh? Yes,we can. Yes. But which? Hmm? What are you laughing at, dear boy? Oh,really, you are\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Room)\n","[DOCTOR] I'd like to talk to you, if I may.

Because I accused you unjustly, you were determined toprove me wrong.

I won't be long.\n","[BOY] Goodnight, Miss Wright.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Laboratory)\n","[IAN] Oh? Not gone yet?\n","[BARBARA] Obviously not.\n","[IAN] Right, ask a silly question.\n","[BARBARA] I'm sorry.\n","[IAN] That's all right. I'll forgive you this time.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I had a terrible day. I don't know what to make of it.\n","[IAN] Oh, what's the trouble? Can I help?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, it's one of the girls, Susan Foreman.\n","[IAN] Susan Foreman? She your problem too?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] You don't know what to make of her?\n","[BARBARA] No.\n","[IAN] How old is she, Barbara?\n","[BARBARA] Fifteen.\n","[IAN] Fifteen. She lets her knowledge out a bit at a time so as not toembarrass me. That's what I feel about her. She knows more science thanI'll ever know. She's a genius. Is that what she's doing with history?\n","[BARBARA] Something like that.\n","[IAN] So your problem is whether to stay in business or to hand over theclass to her.\n","[BARBARA] No, not quite.\n","[IAN] What, then?\n","[BARBARA] Ian, I must talk to someone about this, but I don't want toget the girl into trouble. And I know you're going to tell me I'mimagining things.\n","[IAN] No, I'm not.\n","[BARBARA] Well, I told you how good she is at history. I had a talk withher and told her she ought to specialise. Well, she seemed quiteinterested until I said I'd be willing to work with her at her home.Then she said that would be absolutely impossible as her grandfatherdidn't like strangers.\n","[IAN] He's a doctor, isn't he? That's a bit of a lame excuse.\n","[BARBARA] Well, I didn't pursue the point but then recently herhomework's been so bad.\n","[IAN] Yes, I know.\n","[BARBARA] Finally I got so irritated with all her excuses I decided tohave a talk with this grandfather of hers and tell him to take someinterest in her.\n","[IAN] Did you indeed? And what's the old boy like?\n","[BARBARA] Well, that's just it. I got her address from the secretary, 76Totter's Lane, and I went along there one evening. Oh Ian, do payattention.\n","[IAN] Sorry. You went along there one evening?\n","[BARBARA] There isn't anything there. It's just an old junkyard.\n","[IAN] You must have gone to the wrong place.\n","[BARBARA] Well, that was the address the secretary gave me.\n","[IAN] The secretary got it wrong, then.\n","[BARBARA] No. I checked. There's a big wall on one side, houses on theother and nothing in the middle. And this nothing in the middle isnumber 76 Totter's Lane.\n","[IAN] Hmm. That's a bit of a mystery. Well, there must be a simpleanswer somewhere.\n","[BARBARA] Well, what?\n","[IAN] Well, we'll have to find out for ourselves, won't we?\n","[BARBARA] Thank you for the we. She's waiting in one of the classrooms.I'm lending her a book on the French Revolution.\n","[IAN] What's she going to do, rewrite it? Oh, all right. What do we do?Ask her point-blank?\n","[BARBARA] No, I thought we could drive there, wait till she arrives andsee where she goes.\n","[IAN] Oh, all right.\n","[BARBARA] That is, if you're not doing anything.\n","[IAN] No, I'm not. After you.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Classroom)\n","[BARBARA] Susan?\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Wright. I didn't hear you coming in. Aren'tthey fabulous?\n","[BARBARA] Who?\n","[SUSAN] It's John Smith and the Common Men. They've gone from nineteento two.\n","[IAN] John Smith is the stage name of the Honourable Aubrey Waites. Hestarted his career as Chris Waites and the Carollers, didn't he, Susan?\n","[SUSAN] You are surprising, Mister Chesterton. I wouldn't expect you toknow things like that.\n","[IAN] I have an enquiring mind. And a very sensitive ear.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I'm sorry.\n","[IAN] Thank you.\n","[SUSAN] Is that the book you promised me?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[SUSAN] Thank you very much. It will be interesting. I'll return ittomorrow.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, that's not necessary. Keep it until you've finished it.\n","[SUSAN] I'll have finished it.\n","[IAN] Oh, where do you live, Susan? I'm giving Miss Wright a lift, I'vegot room for one more.\n","[SUSAN] No, thank you, Mister Chesterton. I like walking through thedark. It's mysterious.\n","[BARBARA] Be careful, Susan, there'll probably be fog again tonight.\n","[SUSAN] Mmm.\n","[BARBARA] See you in the morning.\n","[SUSAN] I expect so. Good night.\n","[BARBARA] Good night.\n","[IAN] Good night, Susan.\n","[SUSAN] But that's not right.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Totter's Lane)\n","[BARBARA] Over there.\n","[IAN] We're lucky there was no fog. I'd never have found this.\n","[BARBARA] Well, she doesn't seem to have arrived yet. I suppose we aredoing the right thing, aren't we?\n","[IAN] You can't justify curiosity.\n","[BARBARA] But her homework?\n","[IAN] A bit of an excuse, really, isn't it? I've seen far worse. Thetruth is, we're both curious about Susan and we won't be happy until weknow some of the answers.\n","[BARBARA] You can't just pass it off like that. If I thought I was justbeing a busybody, I'd go straight home. I thought you agreed she was abit of a mystery.\n","[IAN] Yes, but I think you'll find there's a very simple explanation toall this.\n","[BARBARA] Well, I don't know how you explain the fact that a fifteenyear old girl does not know how many shillings there are in a pound.\n","[IAN] Really?\n","[BARBARA] Really. She said she thought we were on the decimal system.\n","[IAN] Decimal system?\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Memory - classroom)\n","[SUSAN] I'm sorry, Miss Wright.\n","[BARBARA] Don't be silly, Susan. The United States has a decimal system.You know perfectly well that we do not.\n","[SUSAN] Of course, the decimal system hasn't started yet.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Totter's Lane)\n","[IAN] I suppose she couldn't be a foreigner? No,doesn't make sense. Nothing about this girl makes sense. For instance,the other day I talking about chemical changes. I'd given out thelitmus paper to show cause and effect\n","[BARBARA] And she knew the answer before you'd started.\n","[IAN] Well, not quite. The answer simply didn't interest her.\n","[SUSAN] Yes, I can see red turns to blue, MisterChesterton, but that's because we're dealing with two inactivechemicals. They only act in relation to each other.\n","[IAN] But that's the whole point of the experiment, Susan.\n","[SUSAN] Yes, it's a bit obvious, isn't it? Well, I'm not trying to berude, but couldn't we deal with two active chemicals? Then red couldturn blue all by itself and get on with something else? I'm sorry, itwas just an idea.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Totter's Lane)\n","[IAN] She means it. These simple experiments arechild's play to her.\n","[BARBARA] You know, it's almost got to the point where I deliberatelywant to trip her up.\n","[IAN] Yes. Something like that happened the other day. I'd set the classa problem with A, B and C as the three dimensions.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Memory - classroom)\n","[SUSAN] It's impossible unless you use D and E.\n","[IAN] D and E? Whatever for? Do the problem that's set, Susan.\n","[SUSAN] I can't, Mister Chesterton. You can't simply work on three ofthe dimensions.\n","[IAN] Three of them? Oh, time being the fourth dimension, I suppose?Then what do you need E for? What do you make the fifth dimension?\n","[SUSAN] Space.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Totter's Lane)\n","[BARBARA] Too many questions and not enoughanswers.\n","[IAN] Stupid? Or just doesn't know. So we have a fifteen year old girlwho is absolutely brilliant at some things, and excruciatingly bad atothers.\n","[BARBARA] There she is.\n","[BARBARA] Look, can we go in now? I hate to think of her alone in thatplace.\n","[IAN] If she is alone. Look, she is fifteen. She might be meeting a boy.Didn't that occur to you?\n","[BARBARA] I almost hope she is.\n","[IAN] What do you mean?\n","[BARBARA] Well, it would be so wonderfully normal. It's silly, isn't it?I feel frightened. As if we're about to interfere in something that isbest left alone.\n","[IAN] Come on, let's get it over with.\n","[BARBARA] Well, don't you feel it?\n","[IAN] I take things as they come. Come on.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Junk yard)\n","[IAN] What a mess. We're not turning over any of this stuff to findher..\n","[BARBARA] Over there?\n","[IAN] Blast.

Mister Chesterton and Miss Wright. Shecan't have got out without us seeing her.\n","[BARBARA] Ian, look at this.\n","[IAN] It's a police box! What on earth's it doing here? These things areusually on the street. Feel it. Feel it. Do you feel it?\n","[BARBARA] It's a faint vibration.\n","[IAN] It's alive!\n","[IAN] It's not connected to anything, unless it's through the floor.\n","[BARBARA] Look, I've had enough. Let's go and find a policeman.\n","[IAN] Yes, all right.\n","[BARBARA] Is that her?\n","[IAN] That's not her. Quick.\n","[SUSAN [OC]] There you are, Grandfather.\n","[BARBARA] It's Susan.\n","[IAN] Shush!\n","[IAN] Excuse me.\n","[DOCTOR] What are you doing here?\n","[IAN] We're looking for a young girl.\n","[DOCTOR] We?\n","[BARBARA] Good evening.\n","[DOCTOR] What do you want?\n","[IAN] One of our pupils, Susan Foreman, came into this yard.\n","[DOCTOR] Really? In here? Are you sure?\n","[BARBARA] Yes, we saw her from across the street.\n","[DOCTOR] (aside) One of their pupils, not the police, then.\n","[IAN] I beg your pardon?\n","[DOCTOR] Why were you were spying on her? Who are you?\n","[IAN] We heard a young girl's voice call out to you.\n","[DOCTOR] Your hearing must be very acute. I didn't hear anything.\n","[BARBARA] It came from in here.\n","[DOCTOR] You imagined it.\n","[BARBARA] I certainly did not imagine it.\n","[DOCTOR] Young man, is it reasonable to suppose that anybody would beinside a cupboard like that, hmm?\n","[IAN] Would it therefore be unreasonable to ask you to let us have alook inside?\n","[DOCTOR] I wonder why I've never seen that before. Now isn't thatstrange. Very damp and dirty.\n","[BARBARA] Won't you help us? We're two of her teachers from the CoalHill School. We saw her come in and we haven't seen her leave.Naturally, we're worried.\n","[DOCTOR] Have to be cleaned. Hmm? Oh, I'm afraid it's none of mybusiness. I suggest you leave here.\n","[IAN] Not until we're satisfied that Susan isn't in there. And frankly,I don't understand your attitude.\n","[DOCTOR] Yours leaves a lot to be desired.\n","[IAN] Will you open the door?\n","[DOCTOR] There's nothing in there.\n","[IAN] Then what are you afraid to show us?\n","[DOCTOR] Afraid? Oh, go away.\n","[IAN] I think we'd better go and fetch a policeman.\n","[DOCTOR] Very well.\n","[IAN] And you're coming with us.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, am I? I don't think so, young man. No, I don't think so.\n","[BARBARA] We can't force him.\n","[IAN] But we can't leave him here. Doesn't it seem obvious to you he'sgot her locked up in there? Look at it. There's no door handle. Theremust be a secret lock somewhere.\n","[BARBARA] That was Susan's voice.\n","[IAN] But of course it was. Susan! Susan! Susan, are you in there? It'sMister Chesterton and Miss Wright, Susan.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you think you're being rather high-handed, young man? Youthought you saw a young girl enter the yard. You imagine you heard hervoice. You believe she might be inside there. It's not verysubstantial, is it?\n","[BARBARA] But why won't you help us?\n","[DOCTOR] I'm not hindering you. If you both want to make fools ofyourselves, I suggest you do what you said you'd do. Go and find apoliceman.\n","[IAN] While you nip off quietly in the other direction.\n","[DOCTOR] Insulting. There's only one way in and out of this yard. Ishall be here when you get back. I want to see your faces when you tryto explain away your behaviour to a policeman.\n","[IAN] Nevertheless, we're going to find one. Come on, Barbara.\n","[SUSAN [OC]] What are you doing out there?\n","[IAN] She is in there!\n","[DOCTOR] Close the door!\n","[IAN] Barbara!\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Tardis)\n","[DOCTOR] Close the door, Susan. I believe these people are known to you.\n","[SUSAN] They're two of my schoolteachers. What are you doing here?\n","[BARBARA] Where are we?\n","[DOCTOR] They must have followed you. That ridiculous school. I knewsomething like this would happen if we stayed in one place too long.\n","[SUSAN] But why should they follow me?\n","[BARBARA] Is this really where you live, Susan?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] And what's wrong with it?\n","[IAN] But it was just a telephone box.\n","[DOCTOR] Perhaps.\n","[BARBARA] And this is your grandfather?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] But why didn't you tell us that?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't discuss my private life with strangers.\n","[IAN] But it was a police telephone box. I walked all around it.Barbara, you saw me.\n","[DOCTOR] You don't deserve any explanations. You pushed your way in hereuninvited and unwelcome.\n","[BARBARA] I think we ought to leave.\n","[IAN] No, just a minute. I know this is absurd, but I feel\n","[DOCTOR] Oh dear, dear, dear dear. This is very\n","[IAN] I walked all round it.\n","[DOCTOR] It's stopped again, you know, and I've tried hmm? Oh, youwouldn't understand.\n","[IAN] But I want to understand.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. By the way, Susan, I managed tofind a replacement for that faulty filament. It's an amateur job, but Ithink it'll serve.\n","[IAN] It's an illusion. It must be.\n","[DOCTOR] What is he talking about now?\n","[SUSAN] What are you doing here?\n","[DOCTOR] You don't understand, so you find excuses. Illusions, indeed?You say you can't fit an enormous building into one of your smallersitting rooms.\n","[IAN] No.\n","[DOCTOR] But you've discovered television, haven't you?\n","[IAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Then by showing an enormous building on your television screen,you can do what seemed impossible, couldn't you?\n","[IAN] Well, yes, but I still don't know\n","[DOCTOR] Not quite clear, is it. I can see by your face that you're notcertain. You don't understand. And I knew you wouldn't. Never mind. Nowthen, which switch was it? No. No, no. Ah yes, that is it. The point isnot whether you understand. What is going to happen to you, hmm?They'll tell everybody about the ship now.\n","[IAN] Ship?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, ship. This doesn't roll along on wheels, you know.\n","[BARBARA] You mean it moves?\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis can go anywhere.\n","[BARBARA] Tardis? I don't understand you, Susan.\n","[SUSAN] Well, I made up the name Tardis from the initials, Time AndRelative Dimension In Space. I thought you'd both understand when yousaw the different dimensions inside from those outside.\n","[IAN] Just let me get this straight. A thing that looks like a policebox, standing in a junkyard, it can move anywhere in time and space?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Quite so.\n","[IAN] But that's ridiculous.\n","[SUSAN] Why won't they believe us?\n","[BARBARA] How can we?\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, don't get exasperated, Susan. Remember the RedIndian. When he saw the first steam train, his savage mind thought itan illusion, too.\n","[IAN] You're treating us like children.\n","[DOCTOR] Am I? The children of my civilisation would be insulted.\n","[IAN] Your civilisation?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my civilisation. I tolerate this century, but I don'tenjoy it. Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in thefourth dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off fromour own planet, without friends or protection. But one day we shall getback. Yes, one day. One day.\n","[SUSAN] It's true. Every word of it's true. You don't know what you'vedone coming in here. Grandfather, let them go now, please. Look, ifthey don't understand, they can't, they can't hurt us at all. Iunderstand these people better than you. Their minds reject things theydon't understand.\n","[DOCTOR] No.\n","[IAN] He can't keep us here.\n","[BARBARA] Susan, listen to me. Can't you see that all this is anillusion? It's a game that you and your grandfather are playing, if youlike, but you can't expect us to believe it.\n","[SUSAN] It's not a game!\n","[BARBARA] But Susan, it's\n","[SUSAN] It's not! Look, I love your school. I loved England in thetwentieth century. The last five months have been the happiest of mylife.\n","[BARBARA] But you are one of us. You look like us, you sound like us.\n","[SUSAN] I was born in another time, another world.\n","[IAN] Now look here, Susan, you. Oh, come on, Barbara, let's get out ofhere.\n","[SUSAN] It's no use, you can't get out. He won't let you go.\n","[IAN] He closed the doors from over there. I saw him. Now, which is it?Which is it? Which control operates the door?\n","[DOCTOR] You still think it's all an illusion?\n","[IAN] I know that free movement time and space is a scientific dream Idon't expect to find solved in a junkyard.\n","[DOCTOR] Your arrogance is nearly as great as your ignorance.\n","[IAN] Will you open the door? Open the door! Susan, will you help us?\n","[SUSAN] I mustn't.\n","[IAN] Very well, then. I'll have to risk it myself.\n","[DOCTOR] I can't stop you.\n","[SUSAN] Don't touch it! It's live!\n","[BARBARA] Ian! What on earth do you think you're doing?\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, let them go now, please.\n","[DOCTOR] And by tomorrow we shall be a public spectacle, a subject fornews and idle gossip.\n","[SUSAN] But they won't say anything.\n","[DOCTOR] My dear child, of course they will. Put yourself in theirplace. They are bound to make some sort of a complaint to theauthorities, or at the very least talk to their friends. If I do letthem go, Susan, you realise of course we must go, too.\n","[SUSAN] No, Grandfather, we've had all this out before.\n","[DOCTOR] There's no alternative, child.\n","[SUSAN] I want to stay! But they're both kind people. Why won't youtrust them? All you've got to do is ask them to promise to keep oursecret\n","[DOCTOR] It's out of the question.\n","[SUSAN] I won't go, Grandfather. I won't leave the twentieth century.I'd rather leave the Tardis and you.\n","[DOCTOR] Now you're being sentimental and childish.\n","[SUSAN] No, I mean it.\n","[DOCTOR] Very well. Then you must go with them. I'll open the door.\n","[BARBARA] Are you coming, Susan?\n","[SUSAN] Oh, no, Grandfather!

What's the matter?\n","[SUSAN] It's his notes. He'd never leave his notebook. It's tooimportant to him. It's got the key codes of all the machines in theship. It's got notes of everywhere we've been to. Something terriblehas happened to him, I know it has. We must find him.\n","[BARBARA] Susan, Susan. We'll find him, I promise you. He can't be faraway.\n","[IAN] What's on the other side of those rocks?\n","[SUSAN] There's a line of trees. There's a gap in them.

If he had not found us, hewould have died too.\n","[HUR] What else did he say?\n","[HORG] He says Orb only shows the secret to the leader.\n","[ZA] I am leader. Orb will show me. I am the son of the great firemaker,but he does not show me how to put flames into the sticks. Kal comes. Ido not kill him. I let him eat with us and sleep in our caves. I willhave to spill some blood and make people bow to me.\n","[ZA] This is a strange creature.\n","[KAL] Is Za, son of the firemaker, afraid of an old man? When will Zamake fire come from his hands?\n","[ZA] When Orb decides it.\n","[KAL] Orb is for strong men. Orb has sent me this creature to make firecome from his fingers. I have seen it. Inside, he's full of fire. Thesmoke comes from his mouth.\n","[ZA] As lies come out of yours. He wears strange skins.\n","[KAL] Za is afraid. There was a strange tree. The creature was in it. Zawould have run away had he seen it.\n","[ZA] Silence!\n","[KAL] When I saw fire come from his fingers I remembered Za, son of thefiremaker. And when the cold comes, you will all die if you wait for Zato make fire for you. I, Kal, am a true leader. We fought like thetiger and the bear. My strength was too much for him. He lay down tosleep. And I, Kal, carried him here to make fire for you.\n","[ZA] Why do you listen to Kal?\n","[HORG] Za has many good skins. He has forgotten what the cold is like.\n","[ZA] Tomorrow, I kill many bears. You all have warm skins.\n","[HORG] I say tomorrow you will rub your hands together and hold them tothe dry sticks and ask Orb to send you fire. And the bears will staywarm in their own skins.\n","[ZA] What I say I will do, I will do.\n","[KAL] The firemaker is dead. You all carry dry sticks with you. Buttonight, I make them burn. I am leader.\n","[HUR] The creature has opened its eyes.\n","[DOCTOR] Where's my, where.\n","[KAL] Do you want fire, or do you want to die in the cold?\n","[ALL] Fire! Fire!\n","[KAL] When it's cold, the tiger comes to our caves again at night. Zawill give you to the tiger. Za will give you to the cold. Za rubs hishands and waits for Orb to remember him. My creature can make fire comefrom his fingers. I have seen it. But I, Kal, brought him here. Thecreature is mine.\n","[ZA] He's just an old man in strange skins. Kal has been with us toolong. It is time he died.\n","[HORG] I say there is truth in both of you. Za speaks truth, but firecannot live in men. And Kal speaks the truth that we die without fire.\n","[HUR] Will my father listen to a woman? If this old man can make firecome from his fingers, let us see it now.\n","[ZA] I say what is to be done here, not old men and women.\n","[KAL] Za tries to talk like his father, the firemaker. Za does not wantto see fire made. But I, Kal, am not afraid of fire. I will make mycreature make fire.\n","[ZA] I will take him to the Cave of Skulls and he will tell me thesecret!\n","[DOCTOR] I can make fire for you. Let me go and I'll make all the fireyou want. You don't have to be afraid of me. I'm an old man. How can anold man like me harm any of you?\n","[ZA] What does he say?\n","[HORG] Fire? He says he can make fire for us.\n","[KAL] He makes it for me and I give you fire. I am firemaker.\n","[ZA] He will make it for me.\n","[DOCTOR] (searching his pockets) My matches. Where are they? I must getback. Must get back to the ship.\n","[KAL] Kal's creature, he makes fire only for Kal.\n","[DOCTOR] Take me back to my ship and I will make fire for you. All thefire you want.\n","[ZA] This is more of your lies. The old man cannot make fire.\n","[KAL] There was a tree and the creature came from in it. And the fire,it came out of his fingers.\n","[ZA] You want to be strong like Za, son of the great firemaker. You allheard him say that there would be fire. There is no fire. Za does nottell you lies. He does not say, I will do this thing, and then not doit. He does not say, I will make you warm, and then leave you to thedark. He does not say, I will fight away the tiger with fire, and thenlet him come to you in the dark. Do you want a liar for your chief?\n","[ALL] No!\n","[KAL] Make fire. Make fire.\n","[HUR] You are trapped in your own lies, Kal.\n","[ZA] Great chief who is afraid of nothing. Oh great Kal, save us fromthe cold. Save us from the tiger.\n","[KAL] Make fire. Make fire come from your fingers as I saw you.\n","[DOCTOR] I have no matches. I cannot make fire. I cannot make fire!\n","[ZA] Let the old man die. And we'll watch the great Kal as he kills hisstrong enemy.\n","[KAL] Make fire! Make fire! Or I kill you now!\n","[ZA] Or we'll keep them and make them hunt for us. It's good to havesomeone to laugh at!\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather!\n","[DOCTOR] If he dies, there will be no fire.\n","[MOTHER] Kill her. Kill her.\n","[ZA] Wait. You cannot kill all our enemies. When Orb gives fire back tothe sky, let him look down on them. Then that is when they die, and Orbwill give us fire again. Take them to the Cave of Skulls.\n","[SUSAN] No! Grandfather!\n","[DOCTOR] All right.\n","[ZA] The woman is mine.\n","[HORG] My daughter is for the leader of the tribe.\n","[ZA] Yes, the woman is mine.\n","[HORG] I do not like what has happened.\n","[ZA] Old men never like new things to happen.\n","[HORG] I was a great leader of many men.\n","[ZA] Many men, yes. They all dies when Orb left the sky and the greatcold was on the ground. And Orb will give me fire again. To me. Not toyou. Just as you will give me her.\n","[HUR] Za will be a strong leader of many men. If you give me to him, hewill remember and always give you meat.\n","[MOTHER] There were leaders before there was fire. Fire will kill us allin the end. You should have killed the four strangers. Kill them.\n","[ZA] I have said we will wait until Orb shines again.

How canshrubs or trees grow in soil like that, hmm?\n","[IAN] Something else that's strange.

They're absolutely still.\n","[IAN] Huh. Like stone, look. Very brittle stone. It crumbles when youtouch it. Look.\n","[DOCTOR] It's petrified. How fascinating, a petrified jungle. Hm.Extraordinary.

Nothing on Earth could looklike this.\n","[BARBARA] It looks like some sculptor's nightmare.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it's certainly alien to anything on your planet. Butyou're wrong about one thing, Chesterfield. This isn't like everythingelse. The animal is solidified, certainly, but it's not crumbly stone.It's metal. Yes, it always was.\n","[IAN] What, even when it was alive? But that's impossible.\n","[DOCTOR] Why? Can't you imagine an animal unless it's flesh, blood andbone, hmm? No, I tell you this is an entirely different formation. Ishould say originally it was some pliable metal held together by amagnetic field, or an inner magnetic field, rather, and it may have hadthe ability to attract it's victims towards it, if they were metal too.\n","[BARBARA] We're not on Earth, then.\n","[DOCTOR] No, certainly not.\n","[IAN] Are you sure?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, certain. And you needn't look at me like that, young man.We started this journey far too hurriedly to make any calculations. Youknow that as well as I do.

The jungle ends over there.\n","[IAN] Try not to be too upset.\n","[BARBARA] I counted so much on just going back to things I recognise andtrust. But here there's nothing to rely on.

Where is he?\n","[SUSAN] Just over there.\n","[BARBARA] Susan. Don't you have anything in the ship that records thejourneys?\n","[SUSAN] Oh, yes. There's a meter fixed to a great big bank of computers.If you feed it with the right sort of information, it can take over thecontrols of the ship and deliver you to any place you want to go.\n","[BARBARA] Then why don't we know where we are?\n","[SUSAN] Well, it's a question of the right information, you see. I don'tsay that Grandfather doesn't know how to work the ship, but he's soforgetful, and then he will go off and. Well, he likes to work on hisown.\n","[BARBARA] So I've noticed.\n","[SUSAN] Anyway, he's only got to do some computations back in the shipand we can move on.\n","[BARBARA] Well, it can't be too soon for me.\n","[DOCTOR] Well now, are we ready?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Doctor, have you worked out yet how all this happened?\n","[DOCTOR] No, not really, not really.

We really must get back to\n","[DOCTOR] Most fascinating.\n","[BARBARA] A city, a huge city.\n","[IAN] Well, Doctor? Can you see anything? Any sign of life?\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no sign of life. No, just buildings. Magnificentbuildings, I\n","[SUSAN] Oh, let me have a look. It's fabulous. Here, you have a look.\n","[IAN] What do you think, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, I don't know. Whatever it was destroyed thevegetation here certainly hasn't damaged the city. But there's no signof life. No movement, no light, no. No, I shall know more about it whenI've been down there.\n","[BARBARA] Down there? Oh, no. We're going back to the ship.\n","[DOCTOR] Now, don't be ridiculous. That city down there is a magnificentsubject for study, and I don't intend to leave here until I'vethoroughly investigated it.\n","[IAN] Well it's too late to talk about it now. It's getting dark. We'lldiscuss it when we get back to the ship.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Whatever you decide, it's too late to get down there now.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, all right then. But I assure you I'm determinedto study that place.\n","[IAN] You can do what you like, as long as you don't endanger the restof us.\n","[DOCTOR] Very well then.

Oh.\n","[IAN] I was wondering if perhaps you\n","[DOCTOR] My dear boy, these eternal questions of yours. Do I know wherewe are, I suppose?\n","[IAN] Now listen, Doctor, I don't want to argue with you. We're fellowtravellers whether we like it or not.

Not bad. What do you think, Barbara?\n","[BARBARA] I think it's delicious.\n","[IAN] My bacon's a bit salty.\n","[DOCTOR] It shouldn't be. It's English.\n","[IAN] No, seriously, Doctor, this is remarkable. I mean, one bite and Itaste the bacon, another and I taste the egg. How do you do it?\n","[DOCTOR] Food has component parts, dear boy.

I've learnt quite a lot from theDaleks.\n","[IAN] The who?\n","[DOCTOR] The Daleks, our captors here. Oh, if I didn't feel so. Oh. ButI was right about the neutron bomb.

How do they complete thecircuit?\n","[SUSAN] Batteries?\n","[DOCTOR] No, no. I believe the Daleks have discovered a way to exploitstatic electricity. Very ingenious, if I'm right.\n","[BARBARA] What, drawing power from the floor?\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. If I'm right, of course. Now, what do we know apartfrom guessing how they are powered?\n","[SUSAN] Well, they can see all round them.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Their eye is flexible, like a large camera lens.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, Chesterton, do you mind concentrating,young man?\n","[IAN] Hmm? Susan. The cloak the Thals gave you.\n","[SUSAN] Yes, it's just behind you.\n","[IAN] Barbara, come here. What do you think this is made of?\n","[BARBARA] I don't know. It isn't plastic, I don't think it's nyloneither.\n","[IAN] Whatever it is, it'll do for what we want.\n","[DOCTOR] And what will it do, young man? Hmm?\n","[IAN] Insulate. If you are right, Doctor, about the Daleks taking uppower from the floor, this is a perfect way of putting them out ofaction.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Thal camp outside the Tardis)\n","[DYONI] Oh, look, Ganatus, they've found a Magneton under some bushes.\n","[GANATUS] Dead, I hope.\n","[DYONI] Well, of course it's dead.

I'm sorry, I\n","[GANATUS] My brother isn't afraid of anything.\n","[ALYDON] Temmosus, suppose the Daleks refuse to help us. What then?\n","[TEMMOSUS] I believe the Daleks hold the key to our future. Whateverthat future may be, we must accept it gracefully and without regret.\n","[ALYDON] I wish I could be as objective as you. We've lived for so longa time.\n","[TEMMOSUS] Perhaps we have lived too long. I've never struggled againstthe inevitable. It's a vain occupation. But I should always advise youto examine very closely what you think to be inevitable. It'ssurprising how often apparent defeat can be turned to victory.\n","[GANATUS] This was found at the city gates.\n","[ALYDON] What does it say?\n","[TEMMOSUS] They're going to help us! It's signed by the girl, Susan. Shesays the Dalek people have no malice towards us, and they hope thatthey can work with us to build a new and safe world, free from the fearof war. They have the ability to produce food by means of syntheticsunlight, and they have left a quantity of it in the entrance hall oftheir main building. We are to collect it tomorrow.

Your faith is something that I prize veryhighly. You all realise, of course, we cannot succeed against theDaleks alone?\n","[BARBARA] Of course not.\n","[DOCTOR] We have a ready-made army here. The Thals. They're strong, andthey have one great advantage against the Daleks. They can move so muchmore quickly.\n","[IAN] They have one great disadvantage. They have no arms or ammunition.\n","[DOCTOR] Well, that's all right, young man. The mind will alwaystriumph. With me to lead them, the Thals are bound to succeed.\n","[SUSAN] But Grandfather, we've been talking and arguing about this allmorning. The Thals won't fight. They're against war.\n","[DOCTOR] My dear child, this is no time for morals. They must fight forus.\n","[IAN] Why?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, my dear young man, I do hope you're not going to bedifficult.\n","[BARBARA] The Doctor's right. Ian, can't you see? If only we can get theThals to attack the city, we could beat the Daleks and get the linkback.\n","[DOCTOR] It's just common sense. Young lady, I've been underestimatingyou.\n","[IAN] I will not allow you to use the Thals to fight for us.\n","[DOCTOR] Are you challenging me?\n","[IAN] Yes, I am.\n","[BARBARA] Do I have any say in this?\n","[IAN] Of course you do.\n","[BARBARA] Well I think the Doctor's right and I want to get out of here.\n","[IAN] I am sorry, I'm not having anyone's death on my conscience.\n","[BARBARA] Except mine and Susan's and the Doctor's?\n","[DOCTOR] Quite so.\n","[IAN] The only way the Thals can fight is if they themselves want to. Itmust have nothing whatsoever to do with us.\n","[SUSAN] I know what you mean. We must help the Thals to save themselvesand not just them help us.\n","[IAN] Exactly.\n","[BARBARA] All you're doing is playing with words.\n","[DOCTOR] We need action, not arguments.\n","[IAN] Now listen, you two. What victory are you going to show thesepeople when most of them have been killed? A fluid link? Is this whatyou're going to hold up to them and say, 'Thank you very much. This iswhat you fought and died for'?\n","[SUSAN] The thing is, can the Thals still fight?\n","[IAN] Well that's what we've got to find out. Are they cowards, or arethey just against fighting on principle?\n","[BARBARA] Well, how can we find out?\n","[IAN] Well, I've got an idea. But whatever I do, don't interfere. I'mnot even sure that I'm right.\n","[IAN] Well, let's see what happens.\n","[DOCTOR] Hmm, strange young man.\n","[SUSAN] He's right, though.\n","[BARBARA] Yes, he is.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we'll see.\n","[IAN] to have self- respect. At this moment, anyone could come in here.They could rob, they could steal.\n","[DOCTOR] Let's see what he's up to.\n","[IAN] They could even kill you. And you wouldn't lift a finger to helpyourselves.\n","[ALYDON] We will not fight. There will be no more wars. Look at ourplanet. This was once a great world, full of ideas and art andinvention. In one day it was destroyed. And you will never find onegood reason why we should ever begin destroying everything again. I'msorry.\n","[IAN] You're not sorry. You stand here, mumbling a lot of words out ofyour history. But it means nothing, nothing at all. You carry thisaround with you. Your history records. Well, it must be valuable toyou. Supposing I take it down to the city and try and trade with theDaleks? Perhaps they'd think it valuable enough to exchange for ourfluid link.\n","[ALYDON] I don't believe you'd do it.\n","[IAN] I would.\n","[ALYDON] None of us would stop you.\n","[IAN] If I don't get the fluid link back, the four of us will die.Perhaps the Daleks are more interested in people? Maybe they wereholding us to experiment on us? I could take them an alternative.\n","[IAN] So there is something you'll fight for.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Experiment chamber)\n","[DALEK] Help. Cannot control.

Do you despise me for hitting him?\n","[DYONI] If you hadn't fought him, I think I would have hated you.\n","[ALYDON] I knew he wouldn't really take you and give you to the Daleks.But I fought him. Oh, I wish Temmosus were here. What would he havesaid, Dyoni? Which is the most important? To fight and live, or to diewithout fighting.\n","[BARBARA] What will happen now?\n","[GANATUS] I don't know. We always do what the leader of our race decidesfor us. He never decides anything without our full approval.\n","[BARBARA] And if Alydon decides not to help us? Well, we'll have to waittill the morning. What's that light in the sky? It's a reflection fromthe city, I suppose.\n","[GANATUS] No, the lake. Some sort of chemical in the water that makes itglow in the moonlight.\n","[BARBARA] You've been down there?\n","[GANATUS] Yes. There's horror down there in the swamp. Five of us wentthere in search of food, and only my brother and I came back.\n","[BARBARA] What happened to the others?\n","[GANATUS] Well, we found what was left of one of them. The lake is alivewith mutations, bred and crossbred until the original has long beenreplaced by. I'm sorry, I'm being morbid.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I don't mind as long as we're this far away. But I wonderwhy the Daleks haven't cleaned it out? Killed everything?\n","[GANATUS] Why should they? Isn't it the perfect defence for the back ofa city? Only a fool would attack the city from the lake.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Control room)\n","[DALEK 2] Has the anti-radiation drug distribution been stopped?\n","[DALEK 3] Yes.

If wedo not help you, what will you do?\n","[IAN] We'll find our way into the city, and take back our lostequipment.\n","[ALYDON] You see, we cannot stand by and let these people die. If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die. But there is a terrible shame inbeing afraid to live. If none of you agree with my reasons, then let mego with these people, and I will help you elect a new chief.\n","[GANATUS] I'll go with you, Alydon.\n","[THAL] And I.\n","[THAL 2] Let's start at once.\n","[ANTODUS] And I.\n","[IAN] Thank you.\n","[ALYDON] You knew what my decision would be.\n","[GANATUS] I could always have destroyed it if you'd decided differently.\n","[DOCTOR] If we get this intelligent anticipation, we shall succeed.Let's see this. Now, what is this area here?\n","[GANATUS] The swamp. Here are the mountains. This is the far side of thecity. I've been into the swamp. It's surrounded by lakes, here, as yousee. The lakes are inhabited by all sorts of strange creatures.\n","[IAN] Can we get into the city this way?\n","[ALYDON] Over the mountains?\n","[IAN] Yes.\n","[GANATUS] That means going through that swamp.\n","[ALYDON] We can't go through the swamp. It's too dangerous.\n","[GANATUS] It is dangerous, yes, but I realised last night when I wastalking to Barbara that it is undefended.\n","[ALYDON] Undefended? It's a perfect natural barrier. All thosecreatures, you know that yourself.\n","[GANATUS] Yes, I know, but I mean the Daleks won't be on guard there.There's a chance to take them by surprise. Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\n","[ALYDON] Yes. Very well then. That is what we must do.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Control room)\n","[DALEK 2] The laser scope is transmitting. Thequality is poor. What has happened?

Except for one serious case, allDaleks in section two have shown signs of recovery.\n","[DALEK 2] Then our position is clear. For us, the drug is a poison.\n","[DALEK 1] And radiation is still necessary to us.\n","[DALEK 2] Essential. I want a complete survey of our stock of nuclearmaterials.

It's your duty to tell them. How we watchedAmezus dragged beneath the waters of the lake, while you and I ran interror when\n","[GANATUS] That's enough. We're going on, Antodus. You keep your fears toyourself. I don't want you upsetting the others. Is that clear?\n","[ANTODUS] Yes.\n","[GANATUS] Well, is it?\n","[ANTODUS] Yes!\n","[GANATUS] Well, this is the swamp. From now on it's going to be ratheruncomfortable.\n","[IAN] Yes, I see what you mean.\n","[GANATUS] The ground's very uneven. Sometimes rock, sometimes thick mud.You'll have to watch how you walk. I think it'll be a wise plan to finda place to rest for the night.\n","[IAN] Yes. We've made very good time. It's only taken four hours to gethere from the edge of the forest. That leaves us with two and a halfdays to go through the mountains to the city.\n","[GANATUS] If there is a way through.\n","[IAN] We'll find a way. I'll go and give Barbara a hand.\n","[GANATUS] I'm surprised you let her come.\n","[IAN] I'd be more surprised if I could have stopped her. How are youdoing?\n","[BARBARA] Fine. Oh, I'm glad the mountaineering's over.\n","[IAN] There'll be some more once we get through this little lot.\n","[BARBARA] We're going through there?\n","[IAN] Well, we must.

The Daleks do get their water from the lake.\n","[GANATUS] But how would it get to the city from there?\n","[IAN] Well, there must be a way. I mean, the Daleks aren't very mobile.They must have cut a pathway through there to work on the pipeline.\n","[GANATUS] How long do you think it will take us to reach there?\n","[ELYON] Most of today. If we could cross the lake we could reach it muchquicker.\n","[IAN] I'm sorry, that's one way I'm not going.\n","[ELYON] Well, it would be dangerous, certainly. The lake is full ofmutations.\n","[GANATUS] No, we must go round.\n","[IAN] Yes, and we ought to try and get there before the sun goes down.\n","[ELYON] Well I'll just go and fill the water bags.

That can't be what's outside the ship.This is a photograph.\n","[DOCTOR] Close the door, Susan!\n","[IAN] I'll do it.\n","[IAN] Well I didn't touch it.\n","[BARBARA] There's another picture.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I recognise that. That's where we nearly lost the Tardis,four or five journey's back.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, the planet Quinnis, of the fourth universe.\n","[SUSAN] That's not outside either. That's a photograph.\n","[IAN] Can you explain it?\n","[DOCTOR] Did I ever tell you that the ship has a memory bank, hmm?\n","[SUSAN] Yes, it records our journeys.\n","[IAN] No, I don't think so.\n","[DOCTOR] Are you sure? I thought I did.\n","[SUSAN] Hey, look.\n","[IAN] Well, what's all that about?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, don't you know? I thought you might be able to explain it.\n","[IAN] Why me?\n","[DOCTOR] Trying to confuse me, eh?\n","[IAN] What are you getting at?\n","[BARBARA] Look, why don't we just try and open the doors and see forourselves what's outside?\n","[DOCTOR] What is inside, madam, is most important at the moment.\n","[BARBARA] Inside?\n","[IAN] But you've just been telling us that the only people inside areourselves.\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. I know now who's responsible. You are. You sabotagedmy ship.\n","[BARBARA] We didn't even touch your ship.\n","[IAN] (overlapping) What are you talking about?\n","[DOCTOR] You're the cause of this disaster. And you knocked both Susanand I unconscious.\n","[BARBARA] Don't be ridiculous. We were all knocked out.\n","[DOCTOR] A charade. You attacked us.\n","[IAN] Absolute nonsense.\n","[DOCTOR] And when we were lying helpless on the floor, you tampered withmy controls.\n","[IAN] But you checked everything yourself and you couldn't find anythingwrong with it.\n","[DOCTOR] No, sir. We checked everything. You and I.\n","[BARBARA] But why would we? For what reason?\n","[DOCTOR] Blackmail, that's why. You tried to force me to return you toEngland.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, don't be so stupid.\n","[DOCTOR] I know it. I'm sure of it.\n","[BARBARA] How dare you! Do you realise, you stupid old man, that you'dhave died in the Cave of Skulls if Ian hadn't made fire for you?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, I\n","[BARBARA] And what about what we went through against the Daleks? Notjust for us, but for you and Susan too. And all because you tricked usinto going down to the city.\n","[DOCTOR] But I, I\n","[BARBARA] Accuse us? You ought to go down on your hands and knees andthank us. But gratitude's the last thing you'll ever have, or any sortof common sense either.\n","[IAN] You can't blame us for this, Doctor. Where is he?\n","[DOCTOR] I've decided we need more time to think. We're all somewhatoverwrought. Mister Chesterton. (offers the cups around) Miss Wright.Susan.\n","[IAN] I wish I could understand you, Doctor. One moment you're abusingus, and the next, you're playing the perfect butler.\n","[DOCTOR] A little nightcap to help us relax and sleep.\n","[IAN] If it is night. We have no way of telling now.\n","[BARBARA] I'm going to bed.\n","[SUSAN] Make it up with her, Grandfather. Please do.\n","[IAN] Doctor, some very strange things are happening. I feel we're in avery dangerous position. This is no time for personal quarrels.\n","[DOCTOR] Meaning?\n","[IAN] I think you should go and apologise to Barbara at once.\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid we have no time for codes and manners. And Icertainly don't underestimate the dangers, if they exist. But I musthave time to think. I must think. Rash action is worse than no actionat all, hmm?\n","[IAN] I don't see anything rash in apologising to Barbara.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Room)\n","[IAN] Frankly, Doctor, I find it hard to keep pacewith you.\n","[DOCTOR] You mean, to keep one jump ahead. That you will never be. Youneed my knowledge and ability to apply it, and then you need myexperience to gain the fullest results.\n","[IAN] Results? For good or for evil?\n","[DOCTOR] One man's law is another man's crime. Sleep on it, Chesterton.Sleep on it.\n","[SUSAN] I'm sorry for what Grandfather said to you.\n","[BARBARA] It wasn't your fault.\n","[SUSAN] I know, but, try and understand him. Forgive him.\n","[BARBARA] Try and get some sleep.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Tardis)\n","[DOCTOR] So, it was you?\n","[BARBARA] Ian!\n","[DOCTOR] It's no use pretending.\n","[BARBARA] Well, help him.\n","[DOCTOR] Help him? You saw him. You saw what he tried to do.\n","[BARBARA] But now he's fainted just like Susan did.\n","[DOCTOR] Susan didn't faint. It was you that told me she fainted and Ivery nearly believed you.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, what does it matter?\n","[DOCTOR] Matter? Matter, young lady? He very nearly tried to strangleme.\n","[BARBARA] But he has fainted. Look at him.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, he's play-acting.\n","[BARBARA] No, he isn't. Oh, Doctor, don't you see? Something terrible'shappening to all of us.\n","[DOCTOR] Not to me. Nothing's happened to me. This is a plot between thetwo of you to get control of my ship.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, that isn't true.\n","[DOCTOR] Can't you see I've found you out? Why won't you admit it, hmm?\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Why don't you?\n","[BARBARA] Susan!\n","[SUSAN] You've been behaving very strangely. Both of you.\n","[BARBARA] But.\n","[SUSAN] I think you're right, Grandfather.\n","[BARBARA] But you're wrong. I swear we haven't done anything.\n","[DOCTOR] I told you i'd treat you as enemies.\n","[SUSAN] No!\n","[DOCTOR] There's no other way.\n","[BARBARA] Well what are you going to do?\n","[DOCTOR] That is my business.\n","[BARBARA] Ian, wake up. For heaven's sake, wake up, Ian. Ian, Ian, helpme.\n","[IAN] I, I, I\n","[DOCTOR] There's no alternative. Your little trick endangered our lives.\n","[SUSAN] How did he get like this?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's all a charade.\n","[BARBARA] He went near the control panel.\n","[SUSAN] It did happen to me, Grandfather.\n","[BARBARA] Yes, you remember. You lost your memory. And there was thisterrible pain at the back of your neck.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Yes, that's true.\n","[BARBARA] What do you think we've done? Hypnotised you? Drugged you?Susan, we wouldn't do anything like that. Believe me.\n","[DOCTOR] I see. Divide and conquer, eh? She's trying to poison your mindagainst me.\n","[IAN] (suddenly sitting up) Don't touch it, Doctor! (and falling backagain)\n","[SUSAN] I do believe you. Grandfather, they couldn't have done all thethings that happened.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes, I admit they were very smart.\n","[SUSAN] No, it's not a question of being smart.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you see I wouldn't allow them to hurt you, child? They'revery resourceful and cunning, and it only leaves me one recourse. Theymust be put off the ship.\n","[SUSAN] No! You can't do that!\n","[DOCTOR] I can and I must.\n","[BARBARA] But you can't open the doors.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't underestimate my powers, young lady.\n","[SUSAN] Look, Grandfather. You've no means of telling what's out there.There may be no air, it may be freezing, it may be too hot to exist.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, or it might be the Earth in the twentieth century. Hadn'tit occurred to you? My ship is very valuable, remember?\n","[BARBARA] Why are you so suspicious of us?\n","[DOCTOR] Put yourself in my place, young lady, and you'd do preciselythe same thing, wouldn't you? Hmm?\n","[IAN] What are you two saying to each other?\n","[DOCTOR] You're getting off the ship, Chesterton.\n","[IAN] Now?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Now. Get up.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] I'll be all right when I get outside.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, Grandfather. He doesn't know what's happening. I won't letyou do this.\n","[DOCTOR] If, of course, they'd like to confess to me what they have doneto my ship, I may even change my mind.\n","[BARBARA] What, what was that?\n","[SUSAN] The danger signal.\n","[DOCTOR] The fault locator! The whole of it!\n","[IAN] Oh, don't touch it, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[IAN] No. No, you'll get knocked out.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Ian.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, tell me.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[DOCTOR] The whole area of the fault locator has just given us awarning.\n","[SUSAN] But everything can't be. Everything can't be wrong!\n","[DOCTOR] That's what it means, child.\n","[BARBARA] No! Ian! Ian, it's all right. It's, it's all right. It's allright.\n","[IAN] I pulled you away. The controls are alive. (passes out)\n","[DOCTOR] No, you mustn't be frightened of me. Not now, please. I can'texplain, but I've just realised the danger we're in.\n","[SUSAN] It went off again, Grandfather.\n","[DOCTOR] Hurry. Look. We must pull him round. You see that panel upthere? You've heard me refer to it? The fault locator?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] If one small piece of apparatus fails, a little bulbilluminates and tells me precisely where the fault is. Can you imaginewhat would happen if the whole of it lights up? Hmm? It means that theship is on the point of disintegration. You're not to blame. All fourof us are to blame!\n","[IAN] Oh, you're all right. That drink you gave us.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, a mere harmless sleeping drug.\n","[IAN] I thought so.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you rather suspected I was up to some mischief.\n","[IAN] Yes. And I told you not to go near the control column. I told youyou'll electrocute yourself.\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid I must have misjudged you both.\n","[SUSAN] Fifteen seconds. It's happening every fifteen seconds.\n","[BARBARA] But all the clock are\n","[SUSAN] I counted.\n","[DOCTOR] Well please go on counting. Now both of you listen. Can youconcentrate?\n","[IAN] Yes, I think I'm all right.\n","[DOCTOR] We're on the brink of destruction, so all four of us must workclosely together. We must find out where we are and what is happeningto my ship.\n","[IAN] Just a moment. Why did you say that, the brink of destruction?\n","[DOCTOR] There's a strong force at work somewhere, which is threateningmy ship. It's so strong that every piece of equipment can be out ofaction at the same time.\n","[IAN] What? Total disintegration?\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. We haven't crash-landed, otherwise I would havediscovered that immediately. And I don't believe there's an evilintelligence in the ship. Just at the same token, I don't reallybelieve that you, either of you, have been the cause of this trouble.\n","[IAN] Well, what is, then?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, but we must find out.\n","[IAN] Yes, but how long have we got?\n","[SUSAN] It's definitely every quarter of a minute.\n","[IAN] Well what does that prove?\n","[BARBARA] That we have a measure of time as long as it lasts. Yes, ofcourse. That explains the clock face. We had time taken away from us,and now it's being given back to us because it's running out.\n","[SUSAN] The column.\n","[DOCTOR] But, it's impossible.\n","[IAN] Doctor, I thought it only moved when the power was on.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. The heart of the machine is under the column.\n","[IAN] Well what made it move?\n","[DOCTOR] The source of power. You see, when the column rises, it provesthe extent of the power thrust.\n","[BARBARA] Then what would have happened if the column had come outcompletely?\n","[SUSAN] Well, the power would be free to escape.\n","[DOCTOR] Can it be possible then, that this is the end?\n","[IAN] The end? What are you talking about?\n","[DOCTOR] We have ten minutes to survive.\n","[BARBARA] Ten minutes? As little as that?\n","[DOCTOR] Maybe less.\n","[IAN] Be careful, Doctor.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's quite safe here. This is where I stood when I triedthe scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Yes. Why is that part safe?\n","[SUSAN] We'll never stop it in time!\n","[BARBARA] Don't, Susan. Please don't.\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know even where to begin, Chesterton. If only I had aclue.\n","[BARBARA] I think. I think, perhaps, we've been given nothing else butclues.\n","[IAN] Have we? Like the food machine, you mean.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] It registered empty, but it wasn't.\n","[BARBARA] But the clock is the most important. It made us aware of time.\n","[SUSAN] By taking time away from us.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. And it replaced time by the light on the fault locator.\n","[IAN] Yes, it did.\n","[DOCTOR] It? It? What do you mean? My machine can't think.\n","[BARBARA] You say it has a built-in defence mechanism?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it has.\n","[BARBARA] Well that's where we've been wrong. Originally, the machinewasn't at fault, we were. And it's been trying to tell us so eversince.\n","[IAN] A machine that can think for itself?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] Is that feasible, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, think not as you or I do, but it must be able to think as amachine. You see, it has a bank of computers.\n","[BARBARA] You say the power is under this column?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] And the column holds it down.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] Well, then, what would make it want to escape?\n","[DOCTOR] I've been racking my brains. I don't know.\n","[IAN] Something outside?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, possible.\n","[IAN] A magnetic force?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, it would have to be a gigantic one. A one as strong as asolar system.\n","[BARBARA] You see? The machine's been warning us all along. All thoseblackouts we had.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. But only if anybody went near the control column.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] But it could be the power escaping.\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, it couldn't. If you felt the power, dear boy, youwouldn't live to speak of it. You'd be blown to atoms in a splitsecond.\n","[SUSAN] Besides, it's the part of it that's safe.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. The scanner. I wonder.\n","[DOCTOR] We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.\n","[DOCTOR] Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again,I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you seeoutside, understand?\n","[DOCTOR] I lied, deliberately, so that they won't know.\n","[IAN] Won't know what?\n","[DOCTOR] We have five minutes only. When the end does come, they won'tknow anything about it.\n","[IAN] There's no hope, then.\n","[DOCTOR] I can't see any. Will you face it with me?\n","[SUSAN] What are you two talking about?\n","[IAN] Oh, just a theory of mine that didn't work.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we must solve this problem, you know. We must.\n","[SUSAN] There's nothing there. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing but space.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Susan.\n","[IAN] Barbara could be right, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] I am right. I know I am. Whenever there's a good picture, thedoors open because it's safe for us to go outside. And then it shows usa terrible picture and the doors close again.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, then we have the sequence. A planet, a planet in the solarsystem, getting further away. Blinding flash. Destruction. Yes, ofcourse. It's our journey.\n","[BARBARA] And the ship refused to destroy itself.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Yes!\n","[BARBARA] The defence mechanism stopped the ship, and it's been tryingto tell us so ever since!\n","[DOCTOR] Of course. Of course!\n","[DOCTOR] I know. I know. I said it would take the force of a total solarsystem to attract the power away from my ship. We're at the verybeginning, the new start of a solar system. Outside, the atoms arerushing towards each other. Fusing, coagulating, until minute littlecollections of matter are created. And so the process goes on, and onuntil dust is formed. Dust then becomes solid entity. A new birth, of asun and its planets.\n","[IAN] But, Doctor, where are we? When we left the planet Skaro, wheredid you ask the machine to take us to? Think, Doctor!\n","[DOCTOR] I, er, had hoped to reach your planet Earth. Skaro was in thefuture and I used the fast return switch.\n","[IAN] The fast return switch? You've sent us back too far. Doctor, showme. Show me that switch. Where is it?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, I can't very well see it without a light, can I?\n","[SUSAN] It's near the scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Really? But that's the part of the control that's safe.\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Strange.\n","[IAN] Doctor, we haven't got very much time left.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I see. Here it is. (pulls a small torch from his pocket)Here, you see? Now, look, there's the switch. You see?\n","[IAN] Yes, well how does it work?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, you merely press it down, and. It's stuck. It hasn'treleased itself!\n","[IAN] What? You mean it's been on all this time?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it must have been.\n","[IAN] Well, come on, Doctor. Let's get it unstuck.\n","[DOCTOR] Hold that. Yes, just a minute now. Yes, there you are, you see?\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\n","[DOCTOR] The spring's not connecting. It's come off the base.\n","[IAN] Hurry, Doctor, hurry.\n","[DOCTOR] There we are. Take it out. Now, luckily we can turn it over andnow it should work. There. Ah, that's all right.\n","[SUSAN] We're safe now.\n","[BARBARA] Are you sure?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we can all relax. We're quite safe now. But it was anarrow squeak.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my child?\n","[SUSAN] What happened?\n","[DOCTOR] What happened? It was the switch. It was still in place. Yousee, there's a little spring inside it and it was stuck. It hadn'treleased itself.\n","[SUSAN] But why didn't the fault locator tell us?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, the switch hadn't broken down, therefore the faultlocator couldn't give us any recognition. You see, let me give you ademonstration. (using his torch) Now, look, when I put my thumb onthere, the light comes on. And it only stays on so long as my thumb ispressing that switch. As soon as I take if off, a little spring insidereleases the switch here and out goes the light.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I see. So if the spring were broken, it would be as if yourfinger were pressing it down all the time.\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. As simple as that. You know, my dear child, I thinkyour old grandfather is going a tiny little bit around the bend. Well,I think you were very brave and I was proud of you.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather? What about them? You said some terrible things tothem. When I thought he was going to attack you, even I was againsthim.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I, I, er, well\n","[IAN] Don't bother to say anything, Doctor. You know there are timeswhen I can read every thought on your face.\n","[DOCTOR] Really? And I always thought that you were a young man withoutany recrimination in you. Well, as for you, young lady, well, you wereabsolutely right. It was your instinct and intuition against my logic,and you succeeded. I mean, the blackouts, and the still pictures andthe clock. Well, you read a story into all these things and weredetermined to hold on to it. We all owe you our lives.\n","[BARBARA] I, I\n","[DOCTOR] You know, I really believe I have underestimated that younglady in the past, Chartow. Well now, we can all start again, eh? Yes,we can. Yes. But which? Hmm? What are you laughing at, dear boy? Oh,really, you are\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Room)\n","[DOCTOR] I'd like to talk to you, if I may. We've landed on a planet andthe air is good, but it's rather cold outside.\n","[BARBARA] Susan told me.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you haven't forgiven me, have you.\n","[BARBARA] You said terrible things to us.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I suppose it's the injustice that's upsetting you, andwhen I made a threat to put you off the ship it must have affected youvery deeply.\n","[BARBARA] What do you care what I think or feel?\n","[DOCTOR] As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves.\n","[BARBARA] Perhaps.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes. Because I accused you unjustly, you were determined toprove me wrong. So, you put your mind to the problem and, luckily, yousolved it.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, we're going out now.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, please, yes. Do open the doors, will you?\n","[SUSAN] Are you coming?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[SUSAN] Good.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, by the way, Susan has left you some wearing apparel foroutside.

Well, that's how they've survived ever since. But they'vealways had to be very, very careful, because the crops have always beenin danger. But, you see, they rely on a great rainfall that onlyhappens about every four or five years. Well, it's two years overduenow, and all their crops are ruined.

Can pacifism become a human instinct?\r\n","[IAN] Pacifism? Is that it? Pacifism only works when everybody feels thesame.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes, but are they really pacifists? I mean, genuinely so. Oris it a belief that's become a reality because they've never had toprove it. DOCTOR\r\n","[IAN] You mean this (humanoid) became\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. It took hundreds of years, of course.

But I wonderwhy the Daleks haven't cleaned it out? Killed everything?\r\n","[GANATUS] Why should they? Isn't it the perfect defence for the back ofa city? Only a fool would attack the city from the lake.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Control room)\r\n","[DALEK 2] Has the anti-radiation drug distribution been stopped?\r\n","[DALEK 3] Yes.

If wedo not help you, what will you do?\r\n","[IAN] We'll find our way into the city, and take back our lostequipment.\r\n","[ALYDON] You see, we cannot stand by and let these people die. If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die. But there is a terrible shame inbeing afraid to live. If none of you agree with my reasons, then let mego with these people, and I will help you elect a new chief.\r\n","[GANATUS] I'll go with you, Alydon.\r\n","[THAL] And I.\r\n","[THAL 2] Let's start at once.\r\n","[ANTODUS] And I.\r\n","[IAN] Thank you.\r\n","[ALYDON] You knew what my decision would be.\r\n","[GANATUS] I could always have destroyed it if you'd decided differently.\r\n","[DOCTOR] If we get this intelligent anticipation, we shall succeed.Let's see this. Now, what is this area here?\r\n","[GANATUS] The swamp. Here are the mountains. This is the far side of thecity. I've been into the swamp. It's surrounded by lakes, here, as yousee. The lakes are inhabited by all sorts of strange creatures.\r\n","[IAN] Can we get into the city this way?\r\n","[ALYDON] Over the mountains?\r\n","[IAN] Yes.\r\n","[GANATUS] That means going through that swamp.\r\n","[ALYDON] We can't go through the swamp. It's too dangerous.\r\n","[GANATUS] It is dangerous, yes, but I realised last night when I wastalking to Barbara that it is undefended.\r\n","[ALYDON] Undefended? It's a perfect natural barrier. All thosecreatures, you know that yourself.\r\n","[GANATUS] Yes, I know, but I mean the Daleks won't be on guard there.There's a chance to take them by surprise. Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\r\n","[ALYDON] Yes.

The Daleks do get their water from the lake.\r\n","[GANATUS] But how would it get to the city from there?\r\n","[IAN] Well, there must be a way. I mean, the Daleks aren't very mobile.They must have cut a pathway through there to work on the pipeline.\r\n","[GANATUS] How long do you think it will take us to reach there?\r\n","[ELYON] Most of today. If we could cross the lake we could reach it muchquicker.\r\n","[IAN] I'm sorry, that's one way I'm not going.\r\n","[ELYON] Well, it would be dangerous, certainly.

Oh, go away.\n","[IAN] I think we'd better go and fetch a policeman.\n","[DOCTOR] Very well.\n","[IAN] And you're coming with us.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, am I? I don't think so, young man. No, I don't think so.\n","[BARBARA] We can't force him.\n","[IAN] But we can't leave him here. Doesn't it seem obvious to you he'sgot her locked up in there? Look at it. There's no door handle. Theremust be a secret lock somewhere.\n","[BARBARA] That was Susan's voice.\n","[IAN] But of course it was. Susan! Susan! Susan, are you in there? It'sMister Chesterton and Miss Wright, Susan.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you think you're being rather high-handed, young man? Youthought you saw a young girl enter the yard. You imagine you heard hervoice. You believe she might be inside there. It's not verysubstantial, is it?\n","[BARBARA] But why won't you help us?\n","[DOCTOR] I'm not hindering you. If you both want to make fools ofyourselves, I suggest you do what you said you'd do. Go and find apoliceman.\n","[IAN] While you nip off quietly in the other direction.\n","[DOCTOR] Insulting. There's only one way in and out of this yard. Ishall be here when you get back.

I believe these people are known to you.\n","[SUSAN] They're two of my schoolteachers. What are you doing here?\n","[BARBARA] Where are we?\n","[DOCTOR] They must have followed you. That ridiculous school. I knewsomething like this would happen if we stayed in one place too long.\n","[SUSAN] But why should they follow me?\n","[BARBARA] Is this really where you live, Susan?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] And what's wrong with it?\n","[IAN] But it was just a telephone box.\n","[DOCTOR] Perhaps.\n","[BARBARA] And this is your grandfather?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] But why didn't you tell us that?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't discuss my private life with strangers.\n","[IAN] But it was a police telephone box. I walked all around it.Barbara, you saw me.\n","[DOCTOR] You don't deserve any explanations. You pushed your way in hereuninvited and unwelcome.\n","[BARBARA] I think we ought to leave.\n","[IAN] No, just a minute. I know this is absurd, but I feel\n","[DOCTOR] Oh dear, dear, dear dear. This is very\n","[IAN] I walked all round it.\n","[DOCTOR] It's stopped again, you know, and I've tried hmm? Oh, youwouldn't understand.\n","[IAN] But I want to understand.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. By the way, Susan, I managed tofind a replacement for that faulty filament. It's an amateur job, but Ithink it'll serve.\n","[IAN] It's an illusion. It must be.\n","[DOCTOR] What is he talking about now?\n","[SUSAN] What are you doing here?\n","[DOCTOR] You don't understand, so you find excuses. Illusions, indeed?You say you can't fit an enormous building into one of your smallersitting rooms.\n","[IAN] No.\n","[DOCTOR] But you've discovered television, haven't you?\n","[IAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Then by showing an enormous building on your television screen,you can do what seemed impossible, couldn't you?\n","[IAN] Well, yes, but I still don't know\n","[DOCTOR] Not quite clear, is it. I can see by your face that you're notcertain. You don't understand. And I knew you wouldn't. Never mind. Nowthen, which switch was it? No. No, no. Ah yes, that is it. The point isnot whether you understand. What is going to happen to you, hmm?They'll tell everybody about the ship now.\n","[IAN] Ship?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, ship. This doesn't roll along on wheels, you know.\n","[BARBARA] You mean it moves?\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis can go anywhere.\n","[BARBARA] Tardis? I don't understand you, Susan.\n","[SUSAN] Well, I made up the name Tardis from the initials, Time AndRelative Dimension In Space. I thought you'd both understand when yousaw the different dimensions inside from those outside.\n","[IAN] Just let me get this straight. A thing that looks like a policebox, standing in a junkyard, it can move anywhere in time and space?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Quite so.\n","[IAN] But that's ridiculous.\n","[SUSAN] Why won't they believe us?\n","[BARBARA] How can we?\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, don't get exasperated, Susan. Remember the RedIndian. When he saw the first steam train, his savage mind thought itan illusion, too.\n","[IAN] You're treating us like children.\n","[DOCTOR] Am I? The children of my civilisation would be insulted.\n","[IAN] Your civilisation?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my civilisation. I tolerate this century, but I don'tenjoy it. Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in thefourth dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off fromour own planet, without friends or protection. But one day we shall getback. Yes, one day. One day.\n","[SUSAN] It's true. Every word of it's true. You don't know what you'vedone coming in here. Grandfather, let them go now, please. Look, ifthey don't understand, they can't, they can't hurt us at all. Iunderstand these people better than you. Their minds reject things theydon't understand.\n","[DOCTOR] No.\n","[IAN] He can't keep us here.\n","[BARBARA] Susan, listen to me. Can't you see that all this is anillusion? It's a game that you and your grandfather are playing, if youlike, but you can't expect us to believe it.\n","[SUSAN] It's not a game!\n","[BARBARA] But Susan, it's\n","[SUSAN] It's not! Look, I love your school. I loved England in thetwentieth century. The last five months have been the happiest of mylife.\n","[BARBARA] But you are one of us. You look like us, you sound like us.\n","[SUSAN] I was born in another time, another world.\n","[IAN] Now look here, Susan, you. Oh, come on, Barbara, let's get out ofhere.\n","[SUSAN] It's no use, you can't get out. He won't let you go.\n","[IAN] He closed the doors from over there. I saw him. Now, which is it?Which is it? Which control operates the door?\n","[DOCTOR] You still think it's all an illusion?\n","[IAN] I know that free movement time and space is a scientific dream Idon't expect to find solved in a junkyard.\n","[DOCTOR] Your arrogance is nearly as great as your ignorance.\n","[IAN] Will you open the door? Open the door! Susan, will you help us?\n","[SUSAN] I mustn't.\n","[IAN] Very well, then. I'll have to risk it myself.\n","[DOCTOR] I can't stop you.\n","[SUSAN] Don't touch it!

What on earth do you think you're doing?\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, let them go now, please.\n","[DOCTOR] And by tomorrow we shall be a public spectacle, a subject fornews and idle gossip.\n","[SUSAN] But they won't say anything.\n","[DOCTOR] My dear child, of course they will. Put yourself in theirplace. They are bound to make some sort of a complaint to theauthorities, or at the very least talk to their friends. If I do letthem go, Susan, you realise of course we must go, too.\n","[SUSAN] No, Grandfather, we've had all this out before.\n","[DOCTOR] There's no alternative, child.\n","[SUSAN] I want to stay! But they're both kind people. Why won't youtrust them? All you've got to do is ask them to promise to keep oursecret\n","[DOCTOR] It's out of the question.\n","[SUSAN] I won't go, Grandfather. I won't leave the twentieth century.I'd rather leave the Tardis and you.\n","[DOCTOR] Now you're being sentimental and childish.\n","[SUSAN] No, I mean it.\n","[DOCTOR] Very well. Then you must go with them. I'll open the door.\n","[BARBARA] Are you coming, Susan?\n","[SUSAN] Oh, no, Grandfather! No!\n","[DOCTOR] Let me go.\n","[SUSAN] No!\n","[DOCTOR] Get back to the ship, child.

But you will lead, the girls inbetween, and I'll bring up the rear. Because that's the safest way.Barbara was probably right.

The whole tribe mightdescend upon us at any moment.\n","[HUR] The tribe is asleep.\n","[DOCTOR] And what about the old woman who cut our bonds? You understand?\n","[IAN] He's right.

Well, he likes to work on hisown.\n","[BARBARA] So I've noticed.\n","[SUSAN] Anyway, he's only got to do some computations back in the shipand we can move on.\n","[BARBARA] Well, it can't be too soon for me.\n","[DOCTOR] Well now, are we ready?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Doctor, have you worked out yet how all this happened?\n","[DOCTOR] No, not really, not really. Whatever it was destroyedeverything that was living, but the planet is dead, totally dead.\n","[IAN] Barbara, Doctor. Over here.\n","[DOCTOR] What is it, Chesterton? We really must get back to\n","[DOCTOR] Most fascinating.\n","[BARBARA] A city, a huge city.\n","[IAN] Well, Doctor? Can you see anything? Any sign of life?\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no sign of life. No, just buildings. Magnificentbuildings, I\n","[SUSAN] Oh, let me have a look. It's fabulous. Here, you have a look.\n","[IAN] What do you think, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, I don't know. Whatever it was destroyed thevegetation here certainly hasn't damaged the city. But there's no signof life. No movement, no light, no. No, I shall know more about it whenI've been down there.\n","[BARBARA] Down there? Oh, no. We're going back to the ship.\n","[DOCTOR] Now, don't be ridiculous. That city down there is a magnificentsubject for study, and I don't intend to leave here until I'vethoroughly investigated it.\n","[IAN] Well it's too late to talk about it now. It's getting dark. We'lldiscuss it when we get back to the ship.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Whatever you decide, it's too late to get down there now.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, all right then. But I assure you I'm determinedto study that place.\n","[IAN] You can do what you like, as long as you don't endanger the restof us.\n","[DOCTOR] Very well then. I shall look at it myself, alone.\n","[IAN] You're the only one who can operate the ship. I'm afraid I can'tlet you do that, Doctor. Your glasses.\n","[IAN] I think this is the way we came.\n","[SUSAN] Who's there?\n","[IAN] All right, Susan, it's all right. You're safe now.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Tardis)\n","[BARBARA] Did Susan tell you what frightened her?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. She's convinced that someone touched her, and I triedto make her see it wasn't possible but I'm afraid she wouldn't listento me. I wonder, would you have a talk with her?\n","[BARBARA] Yes, of course I will.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you know, sometimes I find the gulf between Susan's ageand mine makes difficult understanding between us.\n","[BARBARA] I'll see what I can do.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, would you? Thank you, thank you very much. I'd be grateful.\n","[BARBARA] Hello.\n","[SUSAN] Hello.\n","[BARBARA] What are you doing?\n","[SUSAN] Just drawing.\n","[BARBARA] Well, can I see?\n","[SUSAN] It's the flower I saw in the jungle.\n","[BARBARA] What happened out there?\n","[SUSAN] Nothing.\n","[BARBARA] Well Ian said you were terrified. Well, something must havefrightened you.\n","[SUSAN] It's not that so much. It's just that I'm, I'm fed up no onebelieves me.\n","[BARBARA] Believes what?\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I don't know.\n","[BARBARA] That there was someone out there and they touched you on theshoulder?\n","[SUSAN] There was someone there.\n","[BARBARA] But you didn't see who it was?\n","[SUSAN] No. It was like that. A light touch on the shoulder. I couldn'thave been mistaken.\n","[BARBARA] Well, I believe you.\n","[SUSAN] But Grandfather says that it's impossible for anyone to live outthere.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Susan, it isn't that he doesn't believe you. It's justthat he finds it difficult to go against his scientific facts.\n","[SUSAN] I know.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, look. Why don't you just try and forget it for the moment?\n","[SUSAN] For the moment.\n","[IAN] What's this one for? I don't know how you make sense of any ofthis.\n","[DOCTOR] You're quite right, quite right.\n","[IAN] Can you find where we are? Well, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] Hmm? Oh.\n","[IAN] I was wondering if perhaps you\n","[DOCTOR] My dear boy, these eternal questions of yours. Do I know wherewe are, I suppose?\n","[IAN] Now listen, Doctor, I don't want to argue with you. We're fellowtravellers whether we like it or not. But for heaven's sake try and seeit from our point of view. You've uprooted us violently from our ownlives. You\n","[DOCTOR] You pushed your way into the ship, young man.\n","[IAN] All right, all right, I admit it. A small part of the blame isours.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, small?\n","[IAN] But naturally we're anxious. What are we going to do? Can we livehere? What do we eat? There are millions of questions.\n","[DOCTOR] A very good idea. I'm hungry.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, what's the matter?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I've suddenly got this terrible headache.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, dear, dear, how irksome for you. Oh, this stuff is verygood. This should cure it. Now, not too much, dear, not too much.\n","[SUSAN] No. Oh, Grandfather. I'm sorry I was so silly just now. Here,try this.\n","[BARBARA] Thank you. Oh, it's very nice.\n","[IAN] Let's hope it does you some good.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, did you want something to eat? What would you like?\n","[BARBARA] I'd like some bacon and eggs.\n","[IAN] All right, bacon and eggs.\n","[DOCTOR] Bacon and eggs.\n","[IAN] But\n","[SUSAN] This is fully automatic.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, certainly, certainly. J62.\n","[SUSAN] (turning dials) J62.\n","[DOCTOR] L6.\n","[SUSAN] L6.\n","[IAN] I hope mine doesn't taste of engine grease.\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, now, don't be ridiculous.\n","[BARBARA] Shall I get plates and things?\n","[SUSAN] No, there's no need to.\n","[SUSAN] Eggs and bacon.\n","[DOCTOR] Bacon and eggs.\n","[IAN] What, this?\n","[SUSAN] Go on, try it.\n","[DOCTOR] Well?\n","[IAN] Mm. Not bad. What do you think, Barbara?\n","[BARBARA] I think it's delicious.\n","[IAN] My bacon's a bit salty.\n","[DOCTOR] It shouldn't be. It's English.\n","[IAN] No, seriously, Doctor, this is remarkable. I mean, one bite and Itaste the bacon, another and I taste the egg. How do you do it?\n","[DOCTOR] Food has component parts, dear boy. Flavours are rather likeprimary colours, you know, you blend two to achieve a third, a fourth,etc, etc.\n","[IAN] Well, I think it's wonderful.\n","[SUSAN] How's your headache now?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, it's much better. I don't usually get them at all.\n","[DOCTOR] Susan, would you like something to eat?\n","[SUSAN] No thanks, I'm not hungry.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, child, that's unusual. I do hope your affects outside theship hasn't affected you too much.\n","[SUSAN] No. I think I'll go to bed now, anyway.\n","[DOCTOR] Right.\n","[SUSAN] Do you want to know where you can sleep, Miss Wright?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, yes.\n","[IAN] What's that?\n","[DOCTOR] The scanner.\n","[SUSAN] There was somebody there.\n","[IAN] Nothing. Not a thing.\n","[SUSAN] But something must have made that noise.\n","[BARBARA] Look, I've had enough of this. Please, can't we get out ofhere?\n","[DOCTOR] Ah, but the city. I must see the city.\n","[BARBARA] But why?\n","[DOCTOR] I will not be questioned. Uninvited passengers. I didn't invitethem to the ship. I shall do what I want to do.\n","[IAN] Why endanger the rest of us by staying here?\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, please. Please.\n","[BARBARA] Stone trees are all very well, but the next forest I walkthrough I want them all to be made of wood.\n","[SUSAN] What's the matter?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know. The power take-up was rising normally and\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh don't distract me, please.\n","[SUSAN] Shall I trace it on the fault locator, Grandfather?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I think you'd better, child.\n","[SUSAN] (checking a printout) K7.\n","[DOCTOR] K7? Ah, yes, of course, the fluid link. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, there we are, you see. The end of it's unscrewed itselfand the fluid has run out.\n","[IAN] Have you got a spare?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, no, no need for that. This is easily repaired. All we haveto do is refill it.\n","[IAN] What liquid do you need?\n","[DOCTOR] Mercury.\n","[IAN] Mercury. Can I get it for you?\n","[DOCTOR] No, I'm afraid you can't. We haven't any at all.\n","[IAN] What?\n","[DOCTOR] No.\n","[IAN] Don't you carry a supply?\n","[DOCTOR] No, it hasn't been necessary. This hasn't happened before.\n","[IAN] But you must have some somewhere, surely.\n","[DOCTOR] No, no. We shall have to get some from outside.\n","[BARBARA] But where? There isn't anything outside because\n","[IAN] Yes. There's the city.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, the city, of course. Of course we're bound to get somemercury there. Yes, we're bound to. Well, I mean, what else can we do,hmm?\n","[IAN] It seems we have no alternative. We have to go to the city.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, indeed. At first light, then?\n","[IAN] Well, it's light enough and there doesn't seem to be anything outthere. We might as well get started. Oh, and Doctor. Remember we'regoing to this city to find mercury, and once we've found it we'recoming straight back here. Is that clear?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, quite so, quite so.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Forest)\n","[IAN] Well, shall I lead?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, by all means.\n","[IAN] Look.\n","[BARBARA] Don't touch it, it might go off.\n","[SUSAN] Be careful.\n","[DOCTOR] What is it, Chesterton?\n","[IAN] I don't know. Stand back, all of you.\n","[IAN] I think it's all right. A metal box. It's a box of glass phials.Look.\n","[DOCTOR] Let me see.\n","[SUSAN] Then there was somebody here last night. They must have droppedthem. I knew I was right.\n","[IAN] Yes. Sorry, Susan.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'd like to run a few tests on those. Susan, would youtake these into the ship, please?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Thank you. Oh, and by the way, did you remember the foodsupplies?\n","[SUSAN] Yes. A day's supply for four. That's enough, isn't it?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, ample, ample.\n","[IAN] I trust we won't be more than a couple of hours. You ready, Susan?\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[IAN] Come on, then. Off we go.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(City)\n","[DOCTOR] Do you mind if I sit down for a minute? I feel a bit exhausted.\n","[IAN] You all right?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'm just a bit tired. It was a long journey and my legsare rather weak.\n","[BARBARA] Why don't you rest here? Ian and I will look around and see ifwe can\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no, no, I want to look around too. I shall be allright, thank you.\n","[IAN] I must say, I don't feel too good myself. Look, why don't we getthis over with quickly. Look for instruments, gauges, anything likethat. Ideally what we want is a laboratory.\n","[BARBARA] Ian, look.\n","[IAN] Why don't we separate and go different ways and meet back here insay, ten minutes. All right?\n","[BARBARA] Fine. I'll go this way. (through the door)\n","[DOCTOR] Would you lend me your arm, would you, Susan? Thank you.\n","[SUSAN] Let's try this one. (the door opens for her) There's no light.\n","[IAN] Ah, there you are. Any luck?\n","[SUSAN] No. How about you?\n","[IAN] No, no luck. Barbara should be here by now. Barbara! Barbara!We'll give her a couple of minutes more, and then if she's not backwe'll have to go and look for her.\n","[IAN] We've waited long enough for her. We must go and find her.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(City)\n","[IAN] Barbara? Barbara? Barbara?\n","[SUSAN] Miss Wright?\n","[IAN] Barbara?\n","[SUSAN] Hey, there's a corridor over here.\n","[IAN] We might as well see where it goes to. Come on.\n","[DOCTOR] Wait.\n","[IAN] What's the matter?\n","[DOCTOR] Listen.\n","[SUSAN] I can hear a ticking noise.\n","[DOCTOR] Quiet, child. Now listen.\n","[IAN] Yes. Over here somewhere.\n","[DOCTOR] It's stopped now.\n","[SUSAN] Hey, there it is again.\n","[IAN] It's coming from in here.\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Room)\n","[DOCTOR] Measuring equipment. But measuring what? Look here. Look atthis drum. The ink's still quite wet.\n","[IAN] Yes. Hard to imagine what sort of people these are.\n","[DOCTOR] They're intelligent, anyway. Very intelligent.\n","[IAN] Yes, but how do they use their intelligence? What form does ittake?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, as if that matters. What these instruments tell us is thatwe're in the midst of a very, very advanced civilised society.\n","[SUSAN] Here it is. The thing that's ticking. It's over here. It's aGeiger counter.\n","[IAN] But look at the needle! It's past the danger point.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, that explains a lot of things, doesn't it. A jungleturned to stone, the barren soil and the fact that we're not feelingwell.\n","[IAN] Radiation sickness?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'm afraid so. The atmosphere here is polluted with a veryhigh level of fallout, and we've been walking around in it completelyunprotected.\n","[IAN] What? But how do you explain the buildings? They're intact.\n","[DOCTOR] A neutron bomb. Yes. It destroys all human tissue, but leavesthe buildings and machinery intact. Yes.\n","[IAN] What? But how much radiation, and how badly?\n","[DOCTOR] We need, we need drugs to be treated.\n","[IAN] But where are we going to find them?\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis will have to take us to another time and place wherewe can be cured.\n","[IAN] But don't you remember? We can't move the ship until we find themercury for the fluid link!\n","[DOCTOR] For the fluid link, yes. Yes, I'm afraid I cheated a little onthat. I was determined to see the city, but everybody wanted to go onand, well, to avoid arguments, in short, there's nothing wrong with thefluid link.\n","[SUSAN] What? Grandfather, do you mean to say that you risked leavingthe ship just to see this place?\n","[IAN] You fool. You old fool!\n","[DOCTOR] Abuse me as much as you like, Chesterton. The point is we needan immediate return to the ship, and I suggest we leave at once.\n","[IAN] We're not leaving until we've found Barbara.\n","[DOCTOR] Very well. You may stay and search for her if you wish, butSusan and I are going back to the ship. Now, come along, child.\n","[IAN] All right, carry on, fine. How far do you think you'll get withoutthis? (the fluid link)\n","[DOCTOR] Give that to me.\n","[IAN] Not until we've found Barbara.\n","[DOCTOR] Give it to me, I say.\n","[IAN] No! It's time you faced up to your responsibilities.

We tried to look for you and then thosemachines caught us.\n","[BARBARA] They trapped me in some sort of lift.

Any little thing may help us.\n","[BARBARA] No, nothing much. They moved me from floor to floor, always inlifts. Where we are now must be miles underground.

We haven't any idea what's inside them.\n","[BARBARA] I tried to think of how I could get away from them, but then Ibegan to feel so weak and giddy. It's getting worse now.

Because we were not aware of it until it was too late,that's why.\n","[DALEK 2] No, that is not true. We know the Thals have existed outsideour city.\n","[DALEK 1] The truth is your supply of drugs has failed, and you cameinto the city to see if you could find more.\n","[DOCTOR] No, no. Thals? What are you talking about? We're not Thals, orwhatever you may call them. Can't you see we're very ill.\n","[DALEK 1] You and your companions need a drug to stay alive.\n","[DOCTOR] We have no drugs. (softly) A drug? A drug.

But do they live in thatdead city?\n","[SUSAN] Well, underneath it, anyway. You see, the Daleks want the drugstoo, and they won't let us go until I bring them back to them.\n","[ALYDON] But why should they want the drugs? Surely they must have somethemselves if they're still alive.\n","[SUSAN] I don't know. Look, my grandfather and my friends are terriblyill. I must take the drug back to them.\n","[ALYDON] No. No, no, wait. Are you sure the Daleks want the drugs foryour friends and not for themselves?\n","[SUSAN] I hadn't thought of that.\n","[MAN] Do you trust them?\n","[SUSAN] No. I'm not sure.\n","[ALYDON] You still have the drugs I left for you.

It just means the drug'sworking, that's all.\n","[IAN] This Alydon of yours seems to have kept his wits about him. Givingyou that extra supply of drugs.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. It was strange when the Daleks found it. I thought first ofall they were going to keep both lots. Then they suddenly seemed tochange their mind and gave the second lot back to me.\n","[IAN] Yes. Still, the Thals seem more friendly.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, yes. Alydon gave me this cloak to keep me warm.\n","[BARBARA] Why do the Daleks think they're mutations?\n","[SUSAN] I don't know. Judging by Alydon, they're magnificent people.\n","[DOCTOR] Susan.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather? You'll feel better soon.

Alydon says the Thals aregoing to starve unless they can find new supplies of food. You see,after the war, the Thals that survived managed to cultivate small plotsof land. Well, that's how they've survived ever since. But they'vealways had to be very, very careful, because the crops have always beenin danger. But, you see, they rely on a great rainfall that onlyhappens about every four or five years. Well, it's two years overduenow, and all their crops are ruined.

No. I feelpreserving our prisoners was a good idea.\n","[DALEK 2] And an arrangement to bring the Thals inside our city an evenbetter one.\n","[DALEK 1] We'll let our prisoners sleep and then give them food.

The once famous warrior race of Thals are now farmers.\n","[DYONI] But the Daleks were teachers, weren't they, Temmosus?\n","[TEMMOSUS] Yes, they were.

Any reasonable humanbeings would have responded to him. The Daleks didn't. They obviouslythink and act and feel in an entirely different way. They just aren'thuman.\n","[GANATUS] Yes, but why destroy without any apparent thought or reason?That's what I don't understand.\n","[IAN] Oh, there's a reason. Explanation might be better. It's stupid andridiculous, but it's the only one that fits.\n","[ALYDON] What?\n","[IAN] A dislike for the unlike.\n","[ALYDON] I don't follow you.\n","[IAN] They're afraid of you because you're different from them.

If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die. But there is a terrible shame inbeing afraid to live.

Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\n","[ALYDON] Yes.

I mean, the Daleks aren't very mobile.They must have cut a pathway through there to work on the pipeline.\n","[GANATUS] How long do you think it will take us to reach there?\n","[ELYON] Most of today. If we could cross the lake we could reach it muchquicker.\n","[IAN] I'm sorry, that's one way I'm not going.\n","[ELYON] Well, it would be dangerous, certainly. The lake is full ofmutations.\n","[GANATUS] No, we must go round.\n","[IAN] Yes, and we ought to try and get there before the sun goes down.\n","[ELYON] Well I'll just go and fill the water bags.

It's going away now. That's better. Icouldn't think where I was\n","[BARBARA] Do you want to sit down?\n","[SUSAN] No, it's all right. Grandfather!\n","[BARBARA] He's cut his head open.\n","[SUSAN] I've got some ointment.\n","[BARBARA] Well get some water too.\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[SUSAN] Who's that? Oughtn't we to go and help him?\n","[BARBARA] I don't like the look of this cut at all.\n","[SUSAN] Water. What happened?\n","[BARBARA] I don't know. Well, go on.\n","[IAN] You're working late tonight, Miss Wright. Can I have a glass ofwater?\n","[BARBARA] Susan's fetching some.\n","[IAN] Susan Foreman, you mean?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] What's he doing there?\n","[BARBARA] Oh, he's cut his head. Are you feeling all right?\n","[IAN] Dizzy. Shouldn't we help him? His heart seems all right, and hisbreathing's quite regular. I don't think that cut's as deep as youthink.\n","[BARBARA] What do we do if his skull's fractured?\n","[IAN] I don't think it's as bad as that.\n","[DOCTOR] I can't take you back, Susan. I can't.\n","[IAN] He's rambling.\n","[BARBARA] The ship! The Tardis!\n","[IAN] What?\n","[SUSAN] Empty?\n","[SUSAN] That's funny.\n","[SUSAN] The doors! Well, they can't open on their own. They can't!\n","[IAN] Perhaps he did it.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather?\n","[IAN] Did it before he cut his head open.\n","[SUSAN] No, he wouldn't.\n","[BARBARA] They must have been forced open when we crashed.\n","[IAN] Crashed?\n","[SUSAN] No, the ship can't crash.

What's this?\n","[SUSAN] The coloured part is the ointment. You'll find the colourdisappearing. It goes into the wound. When the bandage is completelywhite, it means the wound is healed.\n","[IAN] Did you do that?\n","[SUSAN] We haven't moved.\n","[SUSAN] I'm going to try the controls.\n","[BARBARA] Be careful, Susan.\n","[IAN] She's fainted.

That can't be what's outside the ship.This is a photograph.\n","[DOCTOR] Close the door, Susan!\n","[IAN] I'll do it.\n","[IAN] Well I didn't touch it.\n","[BARBARA] There's another picture.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I recognise that. That's where we nearly lost the Tardis,four or five journey's back.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, the planet Quinnis, of the fourth universe.\n","[SUSAN] That's not outside either. That's a photograph.\n","[IAN] Can you explain it?\n","[DOCTOR] Did I ever tell you that the ship has a memory bank, hmm?\n","[SUSAN] Yes, it records our journeys.\n","[IAN] No, I don't think so.\n","[DOCTOR] Are you sure? I thought I did.\n","[SUSAN] Hey, look.\n","[IAN] Well, what's all that about?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, don't you know? I thought you might be able to explain it.\n","[IAN] Why me?\n","[DOCTOR] Trying to confuse me, eh?\n","[IAN] What are you getting at?\n","[BARBARA] Look, why don't we just try and open the doors and see forourselves what's outside?\n","[DOCTOR] What is inside, madam, is most important at the moment.\n","[BARBARA] Inside?\n","[IAN] But you've just been telling us that the only people inside areourselves.\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. I know now who's responsible. You are. You sabotagedmy ship.\n","[BARBARA] We didn't even touch your ship.\n","[IAN] (overlapping) What are you talking about?\n","[DOCTOR] You're the cause of this disaster. And you knocked both Susanand I unconscious.\n","[BARBARA] Don't be ridiculous. We were all knocked out.\n","[DOCTOR] A charade. You attacked us.\n","[IAN] Absolute nonsense.\n","[DOCTOR] And when we were lying helpless on the floor, you tampered withmy controls.\n","[IAN] But you checked everything yourself and you couldn't find anythingwrong with it.\n","[DOCTOR] No, sir. We checked everything. You and I.\n","[BARBARA] But why would we? For what reason?\n","[DOCTOR] Blackmail, that's why. You tried to force me to return you toEngland.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, don't be so stupid.\n","[DOCTOR] I know it. I'm sure of it.\n","[BARBARA] How dare you! Do you realise, you stupid old man, that you'dhave died in the Cave of Skulls if Ian hadn't made fire for you?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, I\n","[BARBARA] And what about what we went through against the Daleks? Notjust for us, but for you and Susan too. And all because you tricked usinto going down to the city.\n","[DOCTOR] But I, I\n","[BARBARA] Accuse us? You ought to go down on your hands and knees andthank us. But gratitude's the last thing you'll ever have, or any sortof common sense either.\n","[IAN] You can't blame us for this, Doctor. Where is he?\n","[DOCTOR] I've decided we need more time to think. We're all somewhatoverwrought. Mister Chesterton. (offers the cups around) Miss Wright.Susan.\n","[IAN] I wish I could understand you, Doctor. One moment you're abusingus, and the next, you're playing the perfect butler.\n","[DOCTOR] A little nightcap to help us relax and sleep.\n","[IAN] If it is night. We have no way of telling now.\n","[BARBARA] I'm going to bed.\n","[SUSAN] Make it up with her, Grandfather. Please do.\n","[IAN] Doctor, some very strange things are happening. I feel we're in avery dangerous position. This is no time for personal quarrels.\n","[DOCTOR] Meaning?\n","[IAN] I think you should go and apologise to Barbara at once.\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid we have no time for codes and manners. And Icertainly don't underestimate the dangers, if they exist. But I musthave time to think. I must think.

That you will never be. Youneed my knowledge and ability to apply it, and then you need myexperience to gain the fullest results.\n","[IAN] Results? For good or for evil?\n","[DOCTOR] One man's law is another man's crime. Sleep on it, Chesterton.Sleep on it.\n","[SUSAN] I'm sorry for what Grandfather said to you.\n","[BARBARA] It wasn't your fault.\n","[SUSAN] I know, but, try and understand him.

You saw him. You saw what he tried to do.\n","[BARBARA] But now he's fainted just like Susan did.\n","[DOCTOR] Susan didn't faint. It was you that told me she fainted and Ivery nearly believed you.\n","[BARBARA] Oh, what does it matter?\n","[DOCTOR] Matter? Matter, young lady? He very nearly tried to strangleme.\n","[BARBARA] But he has fainted. Look at him.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, he's play-acting.\n","[BARBARA] No, he isn't. Oh, Doctor, don't you see? Something terrible'shappening to all of us.\n","[DOCTOR] Not to me. Nothing's happened to me.

You lost your memory. And there was thisterrible pain at the back of your neck.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Yes, that's true.\n","[BARBARA] What do you think we've done? Hypnotised you? Drugged you?Susan, we wouldn't do anything like that. Believe me.\n","[DOCTOR] I see. Divide and conquer, eh? She's trying to poison your mindagainst me.\n","[IAN] (suddenly sitting up) Don't touch it, Doctor! (and falling backagain)\n","[SUSAN] I do believe you. Grandfather, they couldn't have done all thethings that happened.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes, I admit they were very smart.\n","[SUSAN] No, it's not a question of being smart.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you see I wouldn't allow them to hurt you, child? They'revery resourceful and cunning, and it only leaves me one recourse. Theymust be put off the ship.\n","[SUSAN] No! You can't do that!\n","[DOCTOR] I can and I must.\n","[BARBARA] But you can't open the doors.\n","[DOCTOR] Don't underestimate my powers, young lady.\n","[SUSAN] Look, Grandfather. You've no means of telling what's out there.There may be no air, it may be freezing, it may be too hot to exist.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, or it might be the Earth in the twentieth century. Hadn'tit occurred to you? My ship is very valuable, remember?\n","[BARBARA] Why are you so suspicious of us?\n","[DOCTOR] Put yourself in my place, young lady, and you'd do preciselythe same thing, wouldn't you? Hmm?\n","[IAN] What are you two saying to each other?\n","[DOCTOR] You're getting off the ship, Chesterton.\n","[IAN] Now?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Now. Get up.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] I'll be all right when I get outside.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, Grandfather. He doesn't know what's happening. I won't letyou do this.\n","[DOCTOR] If, of course, they'd like to confess to me what they have doneto my ship, I may even change my mind.\n","[BARBARA] What, what was that?\n","[SUSAN] The danger signal.\n","[DOCTOR] The fault locator! The whole of it!\n","[IAN] Oh, don't touch it, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[IAN] No. No, you'll get knocked out.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Ian.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, tell me.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\n","[DOCTOR] The whole area of the fault locator has just given us awarning.\n","[SUSAN] But everything can't be. Everything can't be wrong!\n","[DOCTOR] That's what it means, child.\n","[BARBARA] No! Ian! Ian, it's all right. It's, it's all right. It's allright.\n","[IAN] I pulled you away. The controls are alive. (passes out)\n","[DOCTOR] No, you mustn't be frightened of me. Not now, please. I can'texplain, but I've just realised the danger we're in.\n","[SUSAN] It went off again, Grandfather.\n","[DOCTOR] Hurry. Look. We must pull him round. You see that panel upthere? You've heard me refer to it? The fault locator?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] If one small piece of apparatus fails, a little bulbilluminates and tells me precisely where the fault is. Can you imaginewhat would happen if the whole of it lights up? Hmm? It means that theship is on the point of disintegration. You're not to blame. All fourof us are to blame!\n","[IAN] Oh, you're all right. That drink you gave us.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, a mere harmless sleeping drug.\n","[IAN] I thought so.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you rather suspected I was up to some mischief.\n","[IAN] Yes. And I told you not to go near the control column. I told youyou'll electrocute yourself.\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid I must have misjudged you both.\n","[SUSAN] Fifteen seconds. It's happening every fifteen seconds.\n","[BARBARA] But all the clock are\n","[SUSAN] I counted.\n","[DOCTOR] Well please go on counting. Now both of you listen. Can youconcentrate?\n","[IAN] Yes, I think I'm all right.\n","[DOCTOR] We're on the brink of destruction, so all four of us must workclosely together. We must find out where we are and what is happeningto my ship.\n","[IAN] Just a moment. Why did you say that, the brink of destruction?\n","[DOCTOR] There's a strong force at work somewhere, which is threateningmy ship. It's so strong that every piece of equipment can be out ofaction at the same time.\n","[IAN] What? Total disintegration?\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. We haven't crash-landed, otherwise I would havediscovered that immediately. And I don't believe there's an evilintelligence in the ship. Just at the same token, I don't reallybelieve that you, either of you, have been the cause of this trouble.\n","[IAN] Well, what is, then?\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, but we must find out.\n","[IAN] Yes, but how long have we got?\n","[SUSAN] It's definitely every quarter of a minute.\n","[IAN] Well what does that prove?\n","[BARBARA] That we have a measure of time as long as it lasts. Yes, ofcourse. That explains the clock face. We had time taken away from us,and now it's being given back to us because it's running out.\n","[SUSAN] The column.\n","[DOCTOR] But, it's impossible.\n","[IAN] Doctor, I thought it only moved when the power was on.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. The heart of the machine is under the column.\n","[IAN] Well what made it move?\n","[DOCTOR] The source of power. You see, when the column rises, it provesthe extent of the power thrust.\n","[BARBARA] Then what would have happened if the column had come outcompletely?\n","[SUSAN] Well, the power would be free to escape.\n","[DOCTOR] Can it be possible then, that this is the end?\n","[IAN] The end? What are you talking about?\n","[DOCTOR] We have ten minutes to survive.\n","[BARBARA] Ten minutes? As little as that?\n","[DOCTOR] Maybe less.\n","[IAN] Be careful, Doctor.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's quite safe here. This is where I stood when I triedthe scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Yes. Why is that part safe?\n","[SUSAN] We'll never stop it in time!\n","[BARBARA] Don't, Susan. Please don't.\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know even where to begin, Chesterton. If only I had aclue.\n","[BARBARA] I think. I think, perhaps, we've been given nothing else butclues.\n","[IAN] Have we? Like the food machine, you mean.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] It registered empty, but it wasn't.\n","[BARBARA] But the clock is the most important. It made us aware of time.\n","[SUSAN] By taking time away from us.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. And it replaced time by the light on the fault locator.\n","[IAN] Yes, it did.\n","[DOCTOR] It? It? What do you mean? My machine can't think.\n","[BARBARA] You say it has a built-in defence mechanism?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it has.\n","[BARBARA] Well that's where we've been wrong. Originally, the machinewasn't at fault, we were. And it's been trying to tell us so eversince.\n","[IAN] A machine that can think for itself?\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] Is that feasible, Doctor?\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, think not as you or I do, but it must be able to think as amachine. You see, it has a bank of computers.\n","[BARBARA] You say the power is under this column?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] And the column holds it down.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\n","[BARBARA] Well, then, what would make it want to escape?\n","[DOCTOR] I've been racking my brains. I don't know.\n","[IAN] Something outside?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, possible.\n","[IAN] A magnetic force?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, it would have to be a gigantic one. A one as strong as asolar system.\n","[BARBARA] You see? The machine's been warning us all along. All thoseblackouts we had.\n","[SUSAN] Yes. But only if anybody went near the control column.\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\n","[IAN] But it could be the power escaping.\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, it couldn't. If you felt the power, dear boy, youwouldn't live to speak of it. You'd be blown to atoms in a splitsecond.\n","[SUSAN] Besides, it's the part of it that's safe.\n","[BARBARA] Yes. The scanner. I wonder.\n","[DOCTOR] We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.\n","[DOCTOR] Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again,I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you seeoutside, understand?\n","[DOCTOR] I lied, deliberately, so that they won't know.\n","[IAN] Won't know what?\n","[DOCTOR] We have five minutes only. When the end does come, they won'tknow anything about it.\n","[IAN] There's no hope, then.\n","[DOCTOR] I can't see any. Will you face it with me?\n","[SUSAN] What are you two talking about?\n","[IAN] Oh, just a theory of mine that didn't work.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we must solve this problem, you know. We must.\n","[SUSAN] There's nothing there. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing but space.\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Susan.\n","[IAN] Barbara could be right, Doctor.\n","[BARBARA] I am right. I know I am. Whenever there's a good picture, thedoors open because it's safe for us to go outside. And then it shows usa terrible picture and the doors close again.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, then we have the sequence. A planet, a planet in the solarsystem, getting further away. Blinding flash. Destruction. Yes, ofcourse. It's our journey.\n","[BARBARA] And the ship refused to destroy itself.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Yes!\n","[BARBARA] The defence mechanism stopped the ship, and it's been tryingto tell us so ever since!\n","[DOCTOR] Of course. Of course!\n","[DOCTOR] I know. I know. I said it would take the force of a total solarsystem to attract the power away from my ship. We're at the verybeginning, the new start of a solar system. Outside, the atoms arerushing towards each other. Fusing, coagulating, until minute littlecollections of matter are created. And so the process goes on, and onuntil dust is formed. Dust then becomes solid entity. A new birth, of asun and its planets.\n","[IAN] But, Doctor, where are we? When we left the planet Skaro, wheredid you ask the machine to take us to? Think, Doctor!\n","[DOCTOR] I, er, had hoped to reach your planet Earth. Skaro was in thefuture and I used the fast return switch.\n","[IAN] The fast return switch? You've sent us back too far. Doctor, showme. Show me that switch. Where is it?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, I can't very well see it without a light, can I?\n","[SUSAN] It's near the scanner switch.\n","[BARBARA] Really? But that's the part of the control that's safe.\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\n","[DOCTOR] Strange.\n","[IAN] Doctor, we haven't got very much time left.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I see. Here it is. (pulls a small torch from his pocket)Here, you see? Now, look, there's the switch. You see?\n","[IAN] Yes, well how does it work?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, you merely press it down, and. It's stuck. It hasn'treleased itself!\n","[IAN] What? You mean it's been on all this time?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it must have been.\n","[IAN] Well, come on, Doctor. Let's get it unstuck.\n","[DOCTOR] Hold that. Yes, just a minute now. Yes, there you are, you see?\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\n","[DOCTOR] The spring's not connecting. It's come off the base.\n","[IAN] Hurry, Doctor, hurry.\n","[DOCTOR] There we are. Take it out. Now, luckily we can turn it over andnow it should work. There. Ah, that's all right.\n","[SUSAN] We're safe now.\n","[BARBARA] Are you sure?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we can all relax. We're quite safe now. But it was anarrow squeak.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather?\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my child?\n","[SUSAN] What happened?\n","[DOCTOR] What happened? It was the switch. It was still in place. Yousee, there's a little spring inside it and it was stuck. It hadn'treleased itself.\n","[SUSAN] But why didn't the fault locator tell us?\n","[DOCTOR] Well, the switch hadn't broken down, therefore the faultlocator couldn't give us any recognition. You see, let me give you ademonstration. (using his torch) Now, look, when I put my thumb onthere, the light comes on. And it only stays on so long as my thumb ispressing that switch. As soon as I take if off, a little spring insidereleases the switch here and out goes the light.\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I see. So if the spring were broken, it would be as if yourfinger were pressing it down all the time.\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. As simple as that. You know, my dear child, I thinkyour old grandfather is going a tiny little bit around the bend. Well,I think you were very brave and I was proud of you.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather? What about them? You said some terrible things tothem. When I thought he was going to attack you, even I was againsthim.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I, I, er, well\n","[IAN] Don't bother to say anything, Doctor. You know there are timeswhen I can read every thought on your face.\n","[DOCTOR] Really? And I always thought that you were a young man withoutany recrimination in you. Well, as for you, young lady, well, you wereabsolutely right. It was your instinct and intuition against my logic,and you succeeded. I mean, the blackouts, and the still pictures andthe clock. Well, you read a story into all these things and weredetermined to hold on to it. We all owe you our lives.\n","[BARBARA] I, I\n","[DOCTOR] You know, I really believe I have underestimated that younglady in the past, Chartow. Well now, we can all start again, eh? Yes,we can. Yes. But which? Hmm? What are you laughing at, dear boy? Oh,really, you are\n","\n","---------------------------------------\n","\n","(Room)\n","[DOCTOR] I'd like to talk to you, if I may. We've landed on a planet andthe air is good, but it's rather cold outside.\n","[BARBARA] Susan told me.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you haven't forgiven me, have you.\n","[BARBARA] You said terrible things to us.\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I suppose it's the injustice that's upsetting you, andwhen I made a threat to put you off the ship it must have affected youvery deeply.\n","[BARBARA] What do you care what I think or feel?\n","[DOCTOR] As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves.\n","[BARBARA] Perhaps.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes. Because I accused you unjustly, you were determined toprove me wrong. So, you put your mind to the problem and, luckily, yousolved it.\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, we're going out now.\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, please, yes.

She lets her knowledge out a bit at a time so as not toembarrass me. That's what I feel about her. She knows more science thanI'll ever know. She's a genius. Is that what she's doing with history?\r\n","[BARBARA] Something like that.\r\n","[IAN] So your problem is whether to stay in business or to hand over theclass to her.\r\n","[BARBARA] No, not quite.\r\n","[IAN] What, then?\r\n","[BARBARA] Ian, I must talk to someone about this, but I don't want toget the girl into trouble. And I know you're going to tell me I'mimagining things.\r\n","[IAN] No, I'm not.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, I told you how good she is at history. I had a talk withher and told her she ought to specialise. Well, she seemed quiteinterested until I said I'd be willing to work with her at her home.Then she said that would be absolutely impossible as her grandfatherdidn't like strangers.\r\n","[IAN] He's a doctor, isn't he? That's a bit of a lame excuse.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, I didn't pursue the point but then recently herhomework's been so bad.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, I know.\r\n","[BARBARA] Finally I got so irritated with all her excuses I decided tohave a talk with this grandfather of hers and tell him to take someinterest in her.\r\n","[IAN] Did you indeed? And what's the old boy like?\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, that's just it. I got her address from the secretary, 76Totter's Lane, and I went along there one evening.

The answer simply didn't interest her.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes, I can see red turns to blue, MisterChesterton, but that's because we're dealing with two inactivechemicals. They only act in relation to each other.\r\n","[IAN] But that's the whole point of the experiment, Susan.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes, it's a bit obvious, isn't it? Well, I'm not trying to berude, but couldn't we deal with two active chemicals? Then red couldturn blue all by itself and get on with something else? I'm sorry, itwas just an idea.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Totter's Lane)\r\n","[IAN] She means it. These simple experiments arechild's play to her.\r\n","[BARBARA] You know, it's almost got to the point where I deliberatelywant to trip her up.\r\n","[IAN] Yes.

I thought you'd both understand when yousaw the different dimensions inside from those outside.\r\n","[IAN] Just let me get this straight. A thing that looks like a policebox, standing in a junkyard, it can move anywhere in time and space?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Quite so.\r\n","[IAN] But that's ridiculous.\r\n","[SUSAN] Why won't they believe us?\r\n","[BARBARA] How can we?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, don't get exasperated, Susan. Remember the RedIndian. When he saw the first steam train, his savage mind thought itan illusion, too.\r\n","[IAN] You're treating us like children.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Am I? The children of my civilisation would be insulted.\r\n","[IAN] Your civilisation?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my civilisation. I tolerate this century, but I don'tenjoy it. Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in thefourth dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off fromour own planet, without friends or protection. But one day we shall getback. Yes, one day. One day.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's true. Every word of it's true. You don't know what you'vedone coming in here. Grandfather, let them go now, please.

Oh, come on, Barbara, let's get out ofhere.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's no use, you can't get out. He won't let you go.\r\n","[IAN] He closed the doors from over there. I saw him. Now, which is it?Which is it? Which control operates the door?\r\n","[DOCTOR] You still think it's all an illusion?\r\n","[IAN] I know that free movement time and space is a scientific dream Idon't expect to find solved in a junkyard.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Your arrogance is nearly as great as your ignorance.\r\n","[IAN] Will you open the door? Open the door! Susan, will you help us?\r\n","[SUSAN] I mustn't.\r\n","[IAN] Very well, then. I'll have to risk it myself.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I can't stop you.\r\n","[SUSAN] Don't touch it!

Put yourself in theirplace. They are bound to make some sort of a complaint to theauthorities, or at the very least talk to their friends.

But they're both kind people. Why won't youtrust them? All you've got to do is ask them to promise to keep oursecret\r\n","[DOCTOR] It's out of the question.\r\n","[SUSAN] I won't go, Grandfather. I won't leave the twentieth century.I'd rather leave the Tardis and you.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now you're being sentimental and childish.\r\n","[SUSAN] No, I mean it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Very well. Then you must go with them. I'll open the door.\r\n","[BARBARA] Are you coming, Susan?\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, no, Grandfather!

You and Susan go in front, Barbara andI'll bring up the rear. Susan seems to remember the way better than anyof us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You seem to have elected yourself leader of this little party.\r\n","[IAN] There isn't time to vote on it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Just so long as you understand I won't follow your ordersblindly.\r\n","[IAN] If there were only two of us, you could find your own way back tothe ship.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Aren't you a tiresome young man!\r\n","[IAN] And you're a stubborn old man.

I want to help him.\r\n","[HUR] Friend?\r\n","[IAN] I want water.\r\n","[HUR] Water.\r\n","[IAN] Go and fetch some water for his wounds.\r\n","[HUR] Water is there.\r\n","[BARBARA] Please, show me. Give me your handkerchief.\r\n","[IAN] Here you are.\r\n","[SUSAN] Is he all right?\r\n","[IAN] I think so. He must have buried his axe head in the animal. Thankyou.\r\n","[HUR] Water comes out of the skin!\r\n","[IAN] Yes. I think most of this is the animal's blood.\r\n","[SUSAN] Good.\r\n","[BARBARA] There's a scar on the side of his head.\r\n","[IAN] Well, we've lost our chance of getting away.

The whole tribe mightdescend upon us at any moment.\r\n","[HUR] The tribe is asleep.\r\n","[DOCTOR] And what about the old woman who cut our bonds? You understand?\r\n","[IAN] He's right.

And you needn't look at me like that, young man.We started this journey far too hurriedly to make any calculations. Youknow that as well as I do. However, we're alive.\r\n","[SUSAN] Hey, Grandfather, look. The jungle ends over there.\r\n","[IAN] Try not to be too upset.\r\n","[BARBARA] I counted so much on just going back to things I recognise andtrust. But here there's nothing to rely on. Nothing.\r\n","[IAN] Well, there's me. Barbara, all I ask you to do is believe, reallybelieve, we'll go back. We will, you know.\r\n","[BARBARA] I wish I was more like you. I'm afraid I'm a very unwillingadventurer.\r\n","[IAN] I'm not exactly reveling in it myself.\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather's talking about fixing our position by the stars.\r\n","[IAN] Good. Where is he?\r\n","[SUSAN] Just over there.\r\n","[BARBARA] Susan. Don't you have anything in the ship that records thejourneys?\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, yes. There's a meter fixed to a great big bank of computers.If you feed it with the right sort of information, it can take over thecontrols of the ship and deliver you to any place you want to go.\r\n","[BARBARA] Then why don't we know where we are?\r\n","[SUSAN] Well, it's a question of the right information, you see. I don'tsay that Grandfather doesn't know how to work the ship, but he's soforgetful, and then he will go off and. Well, he likes to work on hisown.\r\n","[BARBARA] So I've noticed.\r\n","[SUSAN] Anyway, he's only got to do some computations back in the shipand we can move on.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, it can't be too soon for me.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well now, are we ready?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Doctor, have you worked out yet how all this happened?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, not really, not really. Whatever it was destroyedeverything that was living, but the planet is dead, totally dead.\r\n","[IAN] Barbara, Doctor. Over here.\r\n","[DOCTOR] What is it, Chesterton? We really must get back to\r\n","[DOCTOR] Most fascinating.\r\n","[BARBARA] A city, a huge city.\r\n","[IAN] Well, Doctor? Can you see anything? Any sign of life?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no sign of life. No, just buildings. Magnificentbuildings, I\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, let me have a look. It's fabulous. Here, you have a look.\r\n","[IAN] What do you think, Doctor?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, I don't know. Whatever it was destroyed thevegetation here certainly hasn't damaged the city. But there's no signof life. No movement, no light, no. No, I shall know more about it whenI've been down there.\r\n","[BARBARA] Down there? Oh, no. We're going back to the ship.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, don't be ridiculous. That city down there is a magnificentsubject for study, and I don't intend to leave here until I'vethoroughly investigated it.\r\n","[IAN] Well it's too late to talk about it now. It's getting dark. We'lldiscuss it when we get back to the ship.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Whatever you decide, it's too late to get down there now.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, yes, all right then. But I assure you I'm determinedto study that place.\r\n","[IAN] You can do what you like, as long as you don't endanger the restof us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Very well then. I shall look at it myself, alone.\r\n","[IAN] You're the only one who can operate the ship. I'm afraid I can'tlet you do that, Doctor. Your glasses.\r\n","[IAN] I think this is the way we came.\r\n","[SUSAN] Who's there?\r\n","[IAN] All right, Susan, it's all right. You're safe now.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Tardis)\r\n","[BARBARA] Did Susan tell you what frightened her?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. She's convinced that someone touched her, and I triedto make her see it wasn't possible but I'm afraid she wouldn't listento me. I wonder, would you have a talk with her?\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes, of course I will.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you know, sometimes I find the gulf between Susan's ageand mine makes difficult understanding between us.\r\n","[BARBARA] I'll see what I can do.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, would you? Thank you, thank you very much. I'd be grateful.\r\n","[BARBARA] Hello.\r\n","[SUSAN] Hello.\r\n","[BARBARA] What are you doing?\r\n","[SUSAN] Just drawing.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, can I see?\r\n","[SUSAN] It's the flower I saw in the jungle.\r\n","[BARBARA] What happened out there?\r\n","[SUSAN] Nothing.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well Ian said you were terrified. Well, something must havefrightened you.\r\n","[SUSAN] It's not that so much. It's just that I'm, I'm fed up no onebelieves me.\r\n","[BARBARA] Believes what?\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I don't know.\r\n","[BARBARA] That there was someone out there and they touched you on theshoulder?\r\n","[SUSAN] There was someone there.\r\n","[BARBARA] But you didn't see who it was?\r\n","[SUSAN] No. It was like that. A light touch on the shoulder. I couldn'thave been mistaken.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, I believe you.\r\n","[SUSAN] But Grandfather says that it's impossible for anyone to live outthere.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, Susan, it isn't that he doesn't believe you. It's justthat he finds it difficult to go against his scientific facts.\r\n","[SUSAN] I know.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, look. Why don't you just try and forget it for the moment?\r\n","[SUSAN] For the moment.\r\n","[IAN] What's this one for? I don't know how you make sense of any ofthis.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You're quite right, quite right.\r\n","[IAN] Can you find where we are? Well, Doctor?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hmm? Oh.\r\n","[IAN] I was wondering if perhaps you\r\n","[DOCTOR] My dear boy, these eternal questions of yours. Do I know wherewe are, I suppose?\r\n","[IAN] Now listen, Doctor, I don't want to argue with you. We're fellowtravellers whether we like it or not. But for heaven's sake try and seeit from our point of view. You've uprooted us violently from our ownlives. You\r\n","[DOCTOR] You pushed your way into the ship, young man.\r\n","[IAN] All right, all right, I admit it. A small part of the blame isours.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, small?\r\n","[IAN] But naturally we're anxious. What are we going to do? Can we livehere? What do we eat? There are millions of questions.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A very good idea. I'm hungry.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, what's the matter?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, I've suddenly got this terrible headache.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, dear, dear, how irksome for you. Oh, this stuff is verygood. This should cure it. Now, not too much, dear, not too much.\r\n","[SUSAN] No. Oh, Grandfather. I'm sorry I was so silly just now. Here,try this.\r\n","[BARBARA] Thank you. Oh, it's very nice.\r\n","[IAN] Let's hope it does you some good.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, did you want something to eat? What would you like?\r\n","[BARBARA] I'd like some bacon and eggs.\r\n","[IAN] All right, bacon and eggs.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Bacon and eggs.\r\n","[IAN] But\r\n","[SUSAN] This is fully automatic.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, certainly, certainly. J62.\r\n","[SUSAN] (turning dials) J62.\r\n","[DOCTOR] L6.\r\n","[SUSAN] L6.\r\n","[IAN] I hope mine doesn't taste of engine grease.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, now, now, don't be ridiculous.\r\n","[BARBARA] Shall I get plates and things?\r\n","[SUSAN] No, there's no need to.\r\n","[SUSAN] Eggs and bacon.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Bacon and eggs.\r\n","[IAN] What, this?\r\n","[SUSAN] Go on, try it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well?\r\n","[IAN] Mm. Not bad. What do you think, Barbara?\r\n","[BARBARA] I think it's delicious.\r\n","[IAN] My bacon's a bit salty.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It shouldn't be. It's English.\r\n","[IAN] No, seriously, Doctor, this is remarkable. I mean, one bite and Itaste the bacon, another and I taste the egg. How do you do it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Food has component parts, dear boy. Flavours are rather likeprimary colours, you know, you blend two to achieve a third, a fourth,etc, etc.\r\n","[IAN] Well, I think it's wonderful.\r\n","[SUSAN] How's your headache now?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, it's much better. I don't usually get them at all.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Susan, would you like something to eat?\r\n","[SUSAN] No thanks, I'm not hungry.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, child, that's unusual. I do hope your affects outside theship hasn't affected you too much.\r\n","[SUSAN] No. I think I'll go to bed now, anyway.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Right.\r\n","[SUSAN] Do you want to know where you can sleep, Miss Wright?\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, yes.\r\n","[IAN] What's that?\r\n","[DOCTOR] The scanner.\r\n","[SUSAN] There was somebody there.\r\n","[IAN] Nothing. Not a thing.\r\n","[SUSAN] But something must have made that noise.\r\n","[BARBARA] Look, I've had enough of this. Please, can't we get out ofhere?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Ah, but the city. I must see the city.\r\n","[BARBARA] But why?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I will not be questioned. Uninvited passengers. I didn't invitethem to the ship. I shall do what I want to do.\r\n","[IAN] Why endanger the rest of us by staying here?\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, please. Please.\r\n","[BARBARA] Stone trees are all very well, but the next forest I walkthrough I want them all to be made of wood.\r\n","[SUSAN] What's the matter?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know. The power take-up was rising normally and\r\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh don't distract me, please.\r\n","[SUSAN] Shall I trace it on the fault locator, Grandfather?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I think you'd better, child.\r\n","[SUSAN] (checking a printout) K7.\r\n","[DOCTOR] K7? Ah, yes, of course, the fluid link. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, there we are, you see. The end of it's unscrewed itselfand the fluid has run out.\r\n","[IAN] Have you got a spare?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, no, no need for that. This is easily repaired. All we haveto do is refill it.\r\n","[IAN] What liquid do you need?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Mercury.\r\n","[IAN] Mercury. Can I get it for you?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, I'm afraid you can't. We haven't any at all.\r\n","[IAN] What?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No.\r\n","[IAN] Don't you carry a supply?\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, it hasn't been necessary. This hasn't happened before.\r\n","[IAN] But you must have some somewhere, surely.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no. We shall have to get some from outside.\r\n","[BARBARA] But where? There isn't anything outside because\r\n","[IAN] Yes. There's the city.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, the city, of course. Of course we're bound to get somemercury there. Yes, we're bound to. Well, I mean, what else can we do,hmm?\r\n","[IAN] It seems we have no alternative. We have to go to the city.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, indeed. At first light, then?\r\n","[IAN] Well, it's light enough and there doesn't seem to be anything outthere. We might as well get started. Oh, and Doctor. Remember we'regoing to this city to find mercury, and once we've found it we'recoming straight back here. Is that clear?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, quite so, quite so.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Forest)\r\n","[IAN] Well, shall I lead?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, by all means.\r\n","[IAN] Look.\r\n","[BARBARA] Don't touch it, it might go off.\r\n","[SUSAN] Be careful.\r\n","[DOCTOR] What is it, Chesterton?\r\n","[IAN] I don't know. Stand back, all of you.\r\n","[IAN] I think it's all right. A metal box. It's a box of glass phials.Look.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Let me see.\r\n","[SUSAN] Then there was somebody here last night. They must have droppedthem. I knew I was right.\r\n","[IAN] Yes. Sorry, Susan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'd like to run a few tests on those. Susan, would youtake these into the ship, please?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Thank you. Oh, and by the way, did you remember the foodsupplies?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. A day's supply for four. That's enough, isn't it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, ample, ample.\r\n","[IAN] I trust we won't be more than a couple of hours. You ready, Susan?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] Come on, then. Off we go.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(City)\r\n","[DOCTOR] Do you mind if I sit down for a minute? I feel a bit exhausted.\r\n","[IAN] You all right?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'm just a bit tired. It was a long journey and my legsare rather weak.\r\n","[BARBARA] Why don't you rest here? Ian and I will look around and see ifwe can\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, no, no, I want to look around too. I shall be allright, thank you.\r\n","[IAN] I must say, I don't feel too good myself. Look, why don't we getthis over with quickly. Look for instruments, gauges, anything likethat. Ideally what we want is a laboratory.\r\n","[BARBARA] Ian, look.\r\n","[IAN] Why don't we separate and go different ways and meet back here insay, ten minutes. All right?\r\n","[BARBARA] Fine. I'll go this way. (through the door)\r\n","[DOCTOR] Would you lend me your arm, would you, Susan? Thank you.\r\n","[SUSAN] Let's try this one.

Very intelligent.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, but how do they use their intelligence? What form does ittake?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, as if that matters. What these instruments tell us is thatwe're in the midst of a very, very advanced civilised society.\r\n","[SUSAN] Here it is. The thing that's ticking. It's over here. It's aGeiger counter.\r\n","[IAN] But look at the needle! It's past the danger point.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes, that explains a lot of things, doesn't it. A jungleturned to stone, the barren soil and the fact that we're not feelingwell.\r\n","[IAN] Radiation sickness?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I'm afraid so. The atmosphere here is polluted with a veryhigh level of fallout, and we've been walking around in it completelyunprotected.\r\n","[IAN] What? But how do you explain the buildings? They're intact.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A neutron bomb. Yes. It destroys all human tissue, but leavesthe buildings and machinery intact. Yes.\r\n","[IAN] What? But how much radiation, and how badly?\r\n","[DOCTOR] We need, we need drugs to be treated.\r\n","[IAN] But where are we going to find them?\r\n","[SUSAN] The Tardis will have to take us to another time and place wherewe can be cured.\r\n","[IAN] But don't you remember? We can't move the ship until we find themercury for the fluid link!\r\n","[DOCTOR] For the fluid link, yes. Yes, I'm afraid I cheated a little onthat. I was determined to see the city, but everybody wanted to go onand, well, to avoid arguments, in short, there's nothing wrong with thefluid link.\r\n","[SUSAN] What? Grandfather, do you mean to say that you risked leavingthe ship just to see this place?\r\n","[IAN] You fool. You old fool!\r\n","[DOCTOR] Abuse me as much as you like, Chesterton.

But, you see, they rely on a great rainfall that onlyhappens about every four or five years. Well, it's two years overduenow, and all their crops are ruined.

Or are they shockedand horrified, perhaps insanely jealous?\r\n","[TEMMOSUS] You've no reason to say that.

Can pacifism become a human instinct?\r\n","[IAN] Pacifism? Is that it? Pacifism only works when everybody feels thesame.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes, but are they really pacifists? I mean, genuinely so. Oris it a belief that's become a reality because they've never had toprove it. DOCTOR\r\n","[IAN] You mean this (humanoid) became\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. It took hundreds of years, of course.

If we donot help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and theyhate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their cityand kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in avain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We facedeath now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of theDaleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is noindignity in being afraid to die.

The lakes are inhabited by all sorts of strange creatures.\r\n","[IAN] Can we get into the city this way?\r\n","[ALYDON] Over the mountains?\r\n","[IAN] Yes.\r\n","[GANATUS] That means going through that swamp.\r\n","[ALYDON] We can't go through the swamp. It's too dangerous.\r\n","[GANATUS] It is dangerous, yes, but I realised last night when I wastalking to Barbara that it is undefended.\r\n","[ALYDON] Undefended? It's a perfect natural barrier. All thosecreatures, you know that yourself.\r\n","[GANATUS] Yes, I know, but I mean the Daleks won't be on guard there.There's a chance to take them by surprise. Believe me, I'm not happyabout this, but it's the best possible chance there is.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. Theone to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to tryand force a way through the mountains.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, I think that's the best plan.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Are we all agreed?\r\n","[ALYDON] Yes.

Coming.\r\n","[IAN] Are you all right?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh yes, these numbers keep blurring before my eyes, that's all.\r\n","[IAN] What can I do to help?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well if you wouldn't mind standing in front of that indicatorand what you will see will be a series of numbers.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Room)\r\n","[BARBARA] You're awake now. How are you feeling?Susan? You do remember who I am, don't you?\r\n","[SUSAN] Of course I do. You're Barbara.\r\n","[SUSAN] Why?\r\n","[BARBARA] Hmm?\r\n","[SUSAN] There's nothing wrong with me.\r\n","[BARBARA] No, you're, you just need a rest, that's all.\r\n","[SUSAN] Where's Grandfather?\r\n","[BARBARA] He's checking the controls with Ian.\r\n","[SUSAN] Have they found out what's wrong with the ship?\r\n","[BARBARA] Ian thinks there was a power failure.\r\n","[SUSAN] Why did you ask me if I knew who you were?\r\n","[BARBARA] Susan, why don't you give me those scissors? Give them to me.Susan, what's all this about?\r\n","[SUSAN] You said there'd been a power failure.\r\n","[BARBARA] No, I didn't. I said that's what Ian thinks.\r\n","[SUSAN] I overheard the two of you. There's something here in the shipand he doesn't want you to tell me.\r\n","[BARBARA] I see. You just overheard a couple of words and you\r\n","[SUSAN] No! You lied to me.\r\n","[BARBARA] We wouldn't hurt you, Susan. Surely you know that?\r\n","[SUSAN] I never noticed the shadows before. It's so silent in the ship.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Or we're imagining things. We must be. I mean, how wouldanything get into the ship, anyway?\r\n","[SUSAN] The doors were open.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes, but, but where would it hide?\r\n","[SUSAN] In one of us.\r\n","[BARBARA] No. No. We must stop talking about this. I mean, can youimagine what the others would say if we told them? They'd simply laughat us.\r\n","[SUSAN] Supposing there isn't a fault.\r\n","[IAN] You must be clairvoyant. We've just checked everything and it'sall perfect. Which is fantastic. How are you feeling?\r\n","[SUSAN] I'm all right.\r\n","[IAN] Good.\r\n","[SUSAN] What's my grandfather doing?\r\n","[IAN] That's what I came to tell you both. He's decided that the onlyfault can be outside the ship. He's gone to turn on the scanner.\r\n","[SUSAN] No! No, he mustn't!\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Tardis)\r\n","[SUSAN] Don't touch!\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hmm? Are you all right, child?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Grandfather, I tried to touch it, and it was like beinghit, but without any pain.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hit where?\r\n","[SUSAN] Well, the back of my neck hurt.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, rather like mine.\r\n","[IAN] Funny, it didn't affect Barbara and me like that.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, it didn't, did it? I must find out what's outside the ship,Susan. Stand close beside me, will you?\r\n","[SUSAN] Nothing happened to you.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, indeed.\r\n","[BARBARA] Why does he keep looking at us like that?\r\n","[SUSAN] Hey, the scanner's working.\r\n","[BARBARA] That could be England.\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, yes, I remember that.\r\n","[DOCTOR] That's very curious. That can't be what's outside the ship.This is a photograph.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Close the door, Susan!\r\n","[IAN] I'll do it.\r\n","[IAN] Well I didn't touch it.\r\n","[BARBARA] There's another picture.\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I recognise that. That's where we nearly lost the Tardis,four or five journey's back.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, the planet Quinnis, of the fourth universe.\r\n","[SUSAN] That's not outside either. That's a photograph.\r\n","[IAN] Can you explain it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Did I ever tell you that the ship has a memory bank, hmm?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes, it records our journeys.\r\n","[IAN] No, I don't think so.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Are you sure? I thought I did.\r\n","[SUSAN] Hey, look.\r\n","[IAN] Well, what's all that about?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, don't you know? I thought you might be able to explain it.\r\n","[IAN] Why me?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Trying to confuse me, eh?\r\n","[IAN] What are you getting at?\r\n","[BARBARA] Look, why don't we just try and open the doors and see forourselves what's outside?\r\n","[DOCTOR] What is inside, madam, is most important at the moment.\r\n","[BARBARA] Inside?\r\n","[IAN] But you've just been telling us that the only people inside areourselves.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. I know now who's responsible. You are. You sabotagedmy ship.\r\n","[BARBARA] We didn't even touch your ship.\r\n","[IAN] (overlapping) What are you talking about?\r\n","[DOCTOR] You're the cause of this disaster. And you knocked both Susanand I unconscious.\r\n","[BARBARA] Don't be ridiculous. We were all knocked out.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A charade. You attacked us.\r\n","[IAN] Absolute nonsense.\r\n","[DOCTOR] And when we were lying helpless on the floor, you tampered withmy controls.\r\n","[IAN] But you checked everything yourself and you couldn't find anythingwrong with it.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, sir. We checked everything. You and I.\r\n","[BARBARA] But why would we? For what reason?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Blackmail, that's why. You tried to force me to return you toEngland.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, don't be so stupid.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I know it. I'm sure of it.\r\n","[BARBARA] How dare you! Do you realise, you stupid old man, that you'dhave died in the Cave of Skulls if Ian hadn't made fire for you?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, I\r\n","[BARBARA] And what about what we went through against the Daleks? Notjust for us, but for you and Susan too. And all because you tricked usinto going down to the city.\r\n","[DOCTOR] But I, I\r\n","[BARBARA] Accuse us? You ought to go down on your hands and knees andthank us. But gratitude's the last thing you'll ever have, or any sortof common sense either.\r\n","[IAN] You can't blame us for this, Doctor. Where is he?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I've decided we need more time to think. We're all somewhatoverwrought. Mister Chesterton. (offers the cups around) Miss Wright.Susan.\r\n","[IAN] I wish I could understand you, Doctor. One moment you're abusingus, and the next, you're playing the perfect butler.\r\n","[DOCTOR] A little nightcap to help us relax and sleep.\r\n","[IAN] If it is night. We have no way of telling now.\r\n","[BARBARA] I'm going to bed.\r\n","[SUSAN] Make it up with her, Grandfather. Please do.\r\n","[IAN] Doctor, some very strange things are happening. I feel we're in avery dangerous position. This is no time for personal quarrels.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Meaning?\r\n","[IAN] I think you should go and apologise to Barbara at once.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid we have no time for codes and manners. And Icertainly don't underestimate the dangers, if they exist. But I musthave time to think. I must think. Rash action is worse than no actionat all, hmm?\r\n","[IAN] I don't see anything rash in apologising to Barbara.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Room)\r\n","[IAN] Frankly, Doctor, I find it hard to keep pacewith you.\r\n","[DOCTOR] You mean, to keep one jump ahead. That you will never be. Youneed my knowledge and ability to apply it, and then you need myexperience to gain the fullest results.\r\n","[IAN] Results? For good or for evil?\r\n","[DOCTOR] One man's law is another man's crime. Sleep on it, Chesterton.Sleep on it.\r\n","[SUSAN] I'm sorry for what Grandfather said to you.\r\n","[BARBARA] It wasn't your fault.\r\n","[SUSAN] I know, but, try and understand him. Forgive him.\r\n","[BARBARA] Try and get some sleep.\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Tardis)\r\n","[DOCTOR] So, it was you?\r\n","[BARBARA] Ian!\r\n","[DOCTOR] It's no use pretending.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, help him.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Help him? You saw him. You saw what he tried to do.\r\n","[BARBARA] But now he's fainted just like Susan did.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Susan didn't faint. It was you that told me she fainted and Ivery nearly believed you.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, what does it matter?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Matter? Matter, young lady? He very nearly tried to strangleme.\r\n","[BARBARA] But he has fainted. Look at him.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, he's play-acting.\r\n","[BARBARA] No, he isn't. Oh, Doctor, don't you see? Something terrible'shappening to all of us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Not to me. Nothing's happened to me. This is a plot between thetwo of you to get control of my ship.\r\n","[BARBARA] Oh, that isn't true.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Can't you see I've found you out? Why won't you admit it, hmm?\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Why don't you?\r\n","[BARBARA] Susan!\r\n","[SUSAN] You've been behaving very strangely. Both of you.\r\n","[BARBARA] But.\r\n","[SUSAN] I think you're right, Grandfather.\r\n","[BARBARA] But you're wrong. I swear we haven't done anything.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I told you i'd treat you as enemies.\r\n","[SUSAN] No!\r\n","[DOCTOR] There's no other way.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well what are you going to do?\r\n","[DOCTOR] That is my business.\r\n","[BARBARA] Ian, wake up. For heaven's sake, wake up, Ian. Ian, Ian, helpme.\r\n","[IAN] I, I, I\r\n","[DOCTOR] There's no alternative. Your little trick endangered our lives.\r\n","[SUSAN] How did he get like this?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's all a charade.\r\n","[BARBARA] He went near the control panel.\r\n","[SUSAN] It did happen to me, Grandfather.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes, you remember. You lost your memory. And there was thisterrible pain at the back of your neck.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. Yes, that's true.\r\n","[BARBARA] What do you think we've done? Hypnotised you? Drugged you?Susan, we wouldn't do anything like that. Believe me.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I see. Divide and conquer, eh? She's trying to poison your mindagainst me.\r\n","[IAN] (suddenly sitting up) Don't touch it, Doctor! (and falling backagain)\r\n","[SUSAN] I do believe you. Grandfather, they couldn't have done all thethings that happened.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes, I admit they were very smart.\r\n","[SUSAN] No, it's not a question of being smart.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Don't you see I wouldn't allow them to hurt you, child? They'revery resourceful and cunning, and it only leaves me one recourse. Theymust be put off the ship.\r\n","[SUSAN] No! You can't do that!\r\n","[DOCTOR] I can and I must.\r\n","[BARBARA] But you can't open the doors.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Don't underestimate my powers, young lady.\r\n","[SUSAN] Look, Grandfather. You've no means of telling what's out there.There may be no air, it may be freezing, it may be too hot to exist.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, or it might be the Earth in the twentieth century. Hadn'tit occurred to you? My ship is very valuable, remember?\r\n","[BARBARA] Why are you so suspicious of us?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Put yourself in my place, young lady, and you'd do preciselythe same thing, wouldn't you? Hmm?\r\n","[IAN] What are you two saying to each other?\r\n","[DOCTOR] You're getting off the ship, Chesterton.\r\n","[IAN] Now?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Now. Get up.\r\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] You'll have to help me, Barbara.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] I'll be all right when I get outside.\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, Grandfather. He doesn't know what's happening. I won't letyou do this.\r\n","[DOCTOR] If, of course, they'd like to confess to me what they have doneto my ship, I may even change my mind.\r\n","[BARBARA] What, what was that?\r\n","[SUSAN] The danger signal.\r\n","[DOCTOR] The fault locator! The whole of it!\r\n","[IAN] Oh, don't touch it, Doctor.\r\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\r\n","[IAN] No. No, you'll get knocked out.\r\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Ian.\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, tell me.\r\n","[BARBARA] It's all right.\r\n","[DOCTOR] The whole area of the fault locator has just given us awarning.\r\n","[SUSAN] But everything can't be. Everything can't be wrong!\r\n","[DOCTOR] That's what it means, child.\r\n","[BARBARA] No! Ian! Ian, it's all right. It's, it's all right. It's allright.\r\n","[IAN] I pulled you away. The controls are alive. (passes out)\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, you mustn't be frightened of me. Not now, please. I can'texplain, but I've just realised the danger we're in.\r\n","[SUSAN] It went off again, Grandfather.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hurry. Look. We must pull him round. You see that panel upthere? You've heard me refer to it? The fault locator?\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] If one small piece of apparatus fails, a little bulbilluminates and tells me precisely where the fault is. Can you imaginewhat would happen if the whole of it lights up? Hmm? It means that theship is on the point of disintegration. You're not to blame. All fourof us are to blame!\r\n","[IAN] Oh, you're all right. That drink you gave us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, a mere harmless sleeping drug.\r\n","[IAN] I thought so.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you rather suspected I was up to some mischief.\r\n","[IAN] Yes. And I told you not to go near the control column. I told youyou'll electrocute yourself.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I'm afraid I must have misjudged you both.\r\n","[SUSAN] Fifteen seconds. It's happening every fifteen seconds.\r\n","[BARBARA] But all the clock are\r\n","[SUSAN] I counted.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well please go on counting. Now both of you listen. Can youconcentrate?\r\n","[IAN] Yes, I think I'm all right.\r\n","[DOCTOR] We're on the brink of destruction, so all four of us must workclosely together. We must find out where we are and what is happeningto my ship.\r\n","[IAN] Just a moment. Why did you say that, the brink of destruction?\r\n","[DOCTOR] There's a strong force at work somewhere, which is threateningmy ship. It's so strong that every piece of equipment can be out ofaction at the same time.\r\n","[IAN] What? Total disintegration?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. We haven't crash-landed, otherwise I would havediscovered that immediately. And I don't believe there's an evilintelligence in the ship. Just at the same token, I don't reallybelieve that you, either of you, have been the cause of this trouble.\r\n","[IAN] Well, what is, then?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know, but we must find out.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, but how long have we got?\r\n","[SUSAN] It's definitely every quarter of a minute.\r\n","[IAN] Well what does that prove?\r\n","[BARBARA] That we have a measure of time as long as it lasts. Yes, ofcourse. That explains the clock face. We had time taken away from us,and now it's being given back to us because it's running out.\r\n","[SUSAN] The column.\r\n","[DOCTOR] But, it's impossible.\r\n","[IAN] Doctor, I thought it only moved when the power was on.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. The heart of the machine is under the column.\r\n","[IAN] Well what made it move?\r\n","[DOCTOR] The source of power. You see, when the column rises, it provesthe extent of the power thrust.\r\n","[BARBARA] Then what would have happened if the column had come outcompletely?\r\n","[SUSAN] Well, the power would be free to escape.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Can it be possible then, that this is the end?\r\n","[IAN] The end? What are you talking about?\r\n","[DOCTOR] We have ten minutes to survive.\r\n","[BARBARA] Ten minutes? As little as that?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Maybe less.\r\n","[IAN] Be careful, Doctor.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, it's quite safe here. This is where I stood when I triedthe scanner switch.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes. Yes. Why is that part safe?\r\n","[SUSAN] We'll never stop it in time!\r\n","[BARBARA] Don't, Susan. Please don't.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I don't know even where to begin, Chesterton. If only I had aclue.\r\n","[BARBARA] I think. I think, perhaps, we've been given nothing else butclues.\r\n","[IAN] Have we? Like the food machine, you mean.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] It registered empty, but it wasn't.\r\n","[BARBARA] But the clock is the most important. It made us aware of time.\r\n","[SUSAN] By taking time away from us.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes. And it replaced time by the light on the fault locator.\r\n","[IAN] Yes, it did.\r\n","[DOCTOR] It? It? What do you mean? My machine can't think.\r\n","[BARBARA] You say it has a built-in defence mechanism?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it has.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well that's where we've been wrong. Originally, the machinewasn't at fault, we were. And it's been trying to tell us so eversince.\r\n","[IAN] A machine that can think for itself?\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] Is that feasible, Doctor?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, think not as you or I do, but it must be able to think as amachine. You see, it has a bank of computers.\r\n","[BARBARA] You say the power is under this column?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\r\n","[BARBARA] And the column holds it down.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes.\r\n","[BARBARA] Well, then, what would make it want to escape?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I've been racking my brains. I don't know.\r\n","[IAN] Something outside?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, possible.\r\n","[IAN] A magnetic force?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well, it would have to be a gigantic one. A one as strong as asolar system.\r\n","[BARBARA] You see? The machine's been warning us all along. All thoseblackouts we had.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes. But only if anybody went near the control column.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[IAN] But it could be the power escaping.\r\n","[DOCTOR] No, no, it couldn't. If you felt the power, dear boy, youwouldn't live to speak of it. You'd be blown to atoms in a splitsecond.\r\n","[SUSAN] Besides, it's the part of it that's safe.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes. The scanner. I wonder.\r\n","[DOCTOR] We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again,I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you seeoutside, understand?\r\n","[DOCTOR] I lied, deliberately, so that they won't know.\r\n","[IAN] Won't know what?\r\n","[DOCTOR] We have five minutes only. When the end does come, they won'tknow anything about it.\r\n","[IAN] There's no hope, then.\r\n","[DOCTOR] I can't see any. Will you face it with me?\r\n","[SUSAN] What are you two talking about?\r\n","[IAN] Oh, just a theory of mine that didn't work.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we must solve this problem, you know. We must.\r\n","[SUSAN] There's nothing there. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing but space.\r\n","[BARBARA] It's all right, Susan.\r\n","[IAN] Barbara could be right, Doctor.\r\n","[BARBARA] I am right. I know I am. Whenever there's a good picture, thedoors open because it's safe for us to go outside. And then it shows usa terrible picture and the doors close again.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, then we have the sequence. A planet, a planet in the solarsystem, getting further away. Blinding flash. Destruction. Yes, ofcourse. It's our journey.\r\n","[BARBARA] And the ship refused to destroy itself.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes. Yes!\r\n","[BARBARA] The defence mechanism stopped the ship, and it's been tryingto tell us so ever since!\r\n","[DOCTOR] Of course. Of course!\r\n","[DOCTOR] I know. I know. I said it would take the force of a total solarsystem to attract the power away from my ship. We're at the verybeginning, the new start of a solar system. Outside, the atoms arerushing towards each other. Fusing, coagulating, until minute littlecollections of matter are created. And so the process goes on, and onuntil dust is formed. Dust then becomes solid entity. A new birth, of asun and its planets.\r\n","[IAN] But, Doctor, where are we? When we left the planet Skaro, wheredid you ask the machine to take us to? Think, Doctor!\r\n","[DOCTOR] I, er, had hoped to reach your planet Earth. Skaro was in thefuture and I used the fast return switch.\r\n","[IAN] The fast return switch? You've sent us back too far. Doctor, showme. Show me that switch. Where is it?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well, I can't very well see it without a light, can I?\r\n","[SUSAN] It's near the scanner switch.\r\n","[BARBARA] Really? But that's the part of the control that's safe.\r\n","[SUSAN] Yes.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Strange.\r\n","[IAN] Doctor, we haven't got very much time left.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I see. Here it is. (pulls a small torch from his pocket)Here, you see? Now, look, there's the switch. You see?\r\n","[IAN] Yes, well how does it work?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well, you merely press it down, and. It's stuck. It hasn'treleased itself!\r\n","[IAN] What? You mean it's been on all this time?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, it must have been.\r\n","[IAN] Well, come on, Doctor. Let's get it unstuck.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Hold that. Yes, just a minute now. Yes, there you are, you see?\r\n","[IAN] What's wrong?\r\n","[DOCTOR] The spring's not connecting. It's come off the base.\r\n","[IAN] Hurry, Doctor, hurry.\r\n","[DOCTOR] There we are. Take it out. Now, luckily we can turn it over andnow it should work. There. Ah, that's all right.\r\n","[SUSAN] We're safe now.\r\n","[BARBARA] Are you sure?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, we can all relax. We're quite safe now. But it was anarrow squeak.\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, my child?\r\n","[SUSAN] What happened?\r\n","[DOCTOR] What happened? It was the switch. It was still in place. Yousee, there's a little spring inside it and it was stuck. It hadn'treleased itself.\r\n","[SUSAN] But why didn't the fault locator tell us?\r\n","[DOCTOR] Well, the switch hadn't broken down, therefore the faultlocator couldn't give us any recognition. You see, let me give you ademonstration. (using his torch) Now, look, when I put my thumb onthere, the light comes on. And it only stays on so long as my thumb ispressing that switch. As soon as I take if off, a little spring insidereleases the switch here and out goes the light.\r\n","[SUSAN] Oh, I see. So if the spring were broken, it would be as if yourfinger were pressing it down all the time.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Precisely. As simple as that. You know, my dear child, I thinkyour old grandfather is going a tiny little bit around the bend. Well,I think you were very brave and I was proud of you.\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather? What about them? You said some terrible things tothem. When I thought he was going to attack you, even I was againsthim.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I, I, er, well\r\n","[IAN] Don't bother to say anything, Doctor. You know there are timeswhen I can read every thought on your face.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Really? And I always thought that you were a young man withoutany recrimination in you. Well, as for you, young lady, well, you wereabsolutely right. It was your instinct and intuition against my logic,and you succeeded. I mean, the blackouts, and the still pictures andthe clock. Well, you read a story into all these things and weredetermined to hold on to it. We all owe you our lives.\r\n","[BARBARA] I, I\r\n","[DOCTOR] You know, I really believe I have underestimated that younglady in the past, Chartow. Well now, we can all start again, eh? Yes,we can. Yes. But which? Hmm? What are you laughing at, dear boy? Oh,really, you are\r\n","\r\n","---------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","(Room)\r\n","[DOCTOR] I'd like to talk to you, if I may. We've landed on a planet andthe air is good, but it's rather cold outside.\r\n","[BARBARA] Susan told me.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, you haven't forgiven me, have you.\r\n","[BARBARA] You said terrible things to us.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I suppose it's the injustice that's upsetting you, andwhen I made a threat to put you off the ship it must have affected youvery deeply.\r\n","[BARBARA] What do you care what I think or feel?\r\n","[DOCTOR] As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves.\r\n","[BARBARA] Perhaps.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, yes. Because I accused you unjustly, you were determined toprove me wrong. So, you put your mind to the problem and, luckily, yousolved it.\r\n","[SUSAN] Grandfather, we're going out now.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, please, yes. Do open the doors, will you?\r\n","[SUSAN] Are you coming?\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes.\r\n","[SUSAN] Good.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Oh, by the way, Susan has left you some wearing apparel foroutside. You know, we have a very extensive wardrobe here.\r\n","[BARBARA] Yes, she gave me these.\r\n","[DOCTOR] Yes, I think they're rather charming. We must look after you,you know. You're very valuable.

Challenges of Full Fine-Tuning:\n","\n","Memory Requirements: Storing various parameters, including model weights, optimizer states, gradients, forward activations, and temporary memory, poses challenges on consumer hardware.\n","Catastrophic Forgetting: Updating all model weights during supervised learning may lead to forgetting tasks the model was initially proficient in.\n","2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):\n","\n","Selective PEFT Methods: Fine-tune only a subset of the original LLM parameters, with various approaches to identify which parameters to update (not extensively discussed in this course).\n","Reparameterization Methods (e.g., LoRA): Reduce the number of trainable parameters by creating new low-rank transformations of the original network weights.\n","Additive PEFT Methods:\n","Adapter Methods: Introduce new trainable layers within the model architecture, typically inside the encoder or decoder components.\n","Soft Prompt Methods (e.g., Prompt Tuning): Keep the model architecture fixed and manipulate the input to achieve better performance, often by adding trainable parameters to prompt embeddings.\n","3. Advantages of PEFT:\n","\n","Memory Efficiency: PEFT, with frozen or slightly modified LLM weights, significantly reduces memory requirements, allowing for training on a single GPU.\n","Adaptability to Multiple Tasks: PEFT enables efficient adaptation of the original LLM to various tasks without creating new versions of the model for each task.\n","4. Trade-offs in PEFT Methods:\n","\n","Parameter Efficiency vs. Compute Efficiency: Selective methods may exhibit mixed performance with trade-offs between parameter efficiency and compute efficiency.\n","Inference Costs: Different PEFT methods have varying implications for model quality, inference costs, and training
