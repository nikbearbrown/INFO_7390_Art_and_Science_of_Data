    "## Introduction to generative AI and its applications.\n",
    "Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, or other types of data. Unlike traditional AI that predicts and analyzes, generative AI steps into the realm of creation, producing new and realistic content.\n",
    "Generative AI models use neural networks to identify the patterns and structures within existing data to generate new and original content.\n",
    "One of the breakthroughs with generative AI models is the ability to leverage different learning approaches, including unsupervised or semi-supervised learning for training. This has given organizations the ability to more easily and quickly leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to create foundation models. As the name suggests, foundation models can be used as a base for AI systems that can perform multiple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application:\n",
    "1. Language: Text is thought to be the most advanced domain and is the foundation of many generative AI models. Large language models (LLMs) are among the most well-known instances of generative models based on language. Big language models are being used for many other kinds of activities, including as writing essays, writing code, translating texts, and even deciphering genetic sequences.\n",
    "2. Audio: Within the field of generative AI, music, audio, and voice are also developing fields. As examples, consider models that can compose original music, identify objects in films and generate sound effects for them, and compose songs and short audio clips with text inputs.\n",
    "3. Visual: The field of visuals is one in which generative AI is most widely used. This includes making videos, graphs, avatars, and other types of illustrations in three dimensions. It's possible to create images in a variety of artistic styles and use editing and modification techniques to produce visuals. In addition to producing realistic visuals for virtual or augmented reality and 3D models for video games, generative AI models may also construct graphs that display novel chemical compounds and molecules that help in drug discovery, design logos, improve or alter preexisting graphics, and much more.\n",
    "4. Synthetic data: When data is little, restricted, or just not able to accurately handle corner cases, synthetic data can be a very helpful tool for training AI models. One of the most effective ways to address the data difficulties faced by many businesses is to use generative models to create synthetic data. It is made possible by a procedure known as label-efficient learning and covers all modalities and use cases. By either automatically creating more enhanced training data or by developing an internal representation of the data that makes it easier to train AI models with less labeled data, generative AI models can lower the cost of labeling.\n",
    "The impact of generative models is wide-reaching, and its applications are only growing. Listed are just a few examples of how generative AI is helping to advance and transform the fields of transportation, natural sciences, and entertainment.\n"

    "## The relevance of data generation in various data science tasks.\n",
    "Within the broad field of data science, the generation of data is a key component that provides invaluable support for a range of tasks. Data generation is important because it can solve important problems, improve model performance, and help progress data-driven decision making. Let's examine the crucial significance that data generation plays in several categories of data science tasks:\n",
    "1. Model Training and Validation: Synthetic data generation proves instrumental in scenarios where acquiring real-world data is costly, time-consuming, or limited. By augmenting existing datasets with generated samples, machine learning models receive richer training sets, improving their generalization and performance.\n",
    "2. Anomaly Detection: In anomaly detection tasks, where identifying irregular patterns is paramount, synthetic data allows for the creation of diverse anomalies, augmenting the training data and enabling models to recognize a broader spectrum of deviations.\n",
    "3. Privacy-Preserving Techniques: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic data becomes imperative when dealing with sensitive information. By creating synthetic datasets that retain statistical properties of the original data without compromising individual privacy, data scientists can develop robust models while adhering to privacy regulations.\n",
    "Imbalanced Class Problems: Addressing imbalances in class distribution is a common challenge in classification tasks. Synthetic data generation assists in creating additional instances of minority classes, rectifying imbalances and preventing models from being biased toward the majority class.\n",
    "4. Natural Language Processing (NLP): In NLP tasks, where large labeled datasets are often scarce, synthetic data generation aids in expanding training datasets for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation. This approach enhances the language model's ability to generalize to diverse linguistic patterns.\n",
    "5. Image Recognition and Computer Vision: Generating additional images with variations in lighting, angles, or backgrounds contributes to more robust training sets for image recognition models. This is especially beneficial in scenarios where obtaining a vast and diverse collection of real-world images is challenging.\n",
    "6. Time-Series Forecasting: For time-series forecasting, synthetic data can be used to simulate various scenarios, allowing models to learn and adapt to a wider range of potential future developments. This enhances the model's forecasting accuracy and resilience to unforeseen variations.\n",
    "7. Domain Adaptation: Data generation plays a key role in domain adaptation, where models trained on data from one domain need to perform well on a different domain. Synthetic data that simulates the characteristics of the target domain aids in improving the model's adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the importance of data generation in data science tasks lies in its ability to overcome data-related challenges, foster model robustness, and elevate the efficacy of machine learning solutions across diverse applications. As the field continues to evolve, the strategic integration of data generation techniques becomes increasingly integral to unlocking the full potential of data science methodologies.\n"

    "## Theoretical underpinnings of the chosen generative AI method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying framework of GPT-2, like many other language models, is rooted in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP). It's built upon a Transformer architecture, a type of neural network known for its ability to handle sequential data efficiently, like text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key theoretical underpinnings of GPT-2:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Transformer Architecture:</b> GPT-2 is based on the Transformer model introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017. It employs self-attention mechanisms, enabling it to weigh different words in a sentence while processing information in parallel. This attention mechanism helps capture dependencies across the text, providing context for generating coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Self-Attention Mechanism:</b> The self-attention mechanism in the Transformer allows each word in a sequence to attend to all other words in the sequence, learning which words are most important for understanding the context. This mechanism enables GPT-2 to consider the entire context of the input text when generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning:</b> GPT-2 is pre-trained on a massive dataset using unsupervised learning. During pre-training, it learns the statistical properties and structures of natural language. This pre-training phase helps the model understand various language patterns, grammatical rules, and semantic relationships. Additionally, GPT-2 can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or datasets, allowing it to specialize in particular domains or improve performance on specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Language Modeling Objective:</b> GPT-2 is trained using a language modeling objective, where it predicts the likelihood of a word given its context within a sequence of words. This helps the model learn the probabilities of different words occurring in a sequence and enables it to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Deep Neural Networks:</b> GPT-2 consists of multiple layers of neural networks, allowing it to learn complex representations of text data. The depth of the network enables it to capture intricate patterns and relationships in language.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Probabilistic Sampling:</b> When generating responses, GPT-2 uses probabilistic sampling techniques, such as softmax, to select the next word in the sequence based on the learned probabilities of the words in its vocabulary. This probabilistic approach allows for diversity in generated outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These underpinnings collectively empower GPT-2 to understand, generate, and respond to text based on the vast amount of information it has learned from its training data."

    "\n",
    "<b>Probability and Variation:</b> Generative models leverage probabilistic distributions to create variations in generated data. This enables the model to produce diverse outputs that resemble but are not identical to the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation and Improvement:</b> The quality of generated data is often evaluated using metrics specific to the domain, such as image quality metrics (for images) or metrics assessing coherence and relevance (for text). Feedback from these evaluations can be used to improve the generative models.\n",

    "### 1. Loading GPT-2 Model:\n",
    "   - The script loads the GPT-2 tokenizer and model for TensorFlow using the `GPT2Tokenizer` and `TFGPT2LMHeadModel` from the transformers library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Setting Seed:\n",
    "   - The `set_seed(42)` function is used to set a seed for reproducibility, ensuring that the generated text remains consistent across runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Text Generation Function:\n",
    "   - The `generate_text` function takes a user prompt and generates text based on that prompt using the GPT-2 model.\n",
    "   - The input prompt is tokenized using the GPT-2 tokenizer.\n",
    "   - Text is generated using the GPT-2 model with specified parameters such as `max_length`, `no_repeat_ngram_size`, and `top_k`.\n",
    "   - The generated text is decoded using the tokenizer, skipping special tokens, and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Loading Mental Health Data:\n",

    "## Explanation of the Graph Feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User-Provided Mental Health Condition Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The graph displays a bar plot showing the distribution of mental health conditions mentioned by the user.\n",
    "   - The x-axis represents different mental health conditions, and the y-axis represents the count of each condition mentioned by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tracking User Input:**\n",
    "   - The code maintains a dictionary (`user_condition_counts`) to track the counts of conditions mentioned by the user.\n",
    "   - Each time the user mentions a mental health condition in their input prompt, the corresponding count is updated in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Displaying the Graph:**\n",
    "   - The graph is displayed after every 5 generated text answers to provide periodic insights into the user's expressed mental health concerns.\n",
    "   - The matplotlib and seaborn libraries are used to create an informative and visually appealing bar plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance in Mental Health Systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Engagement and Feedback:**\n",
    "   - The graph allows the mental health system to engage users by visually presenting the prevalence of specific mental health conditions in their input prompts.\n",
    "   - It provides a form of feedback to users, helping them see patterns and trends in their expressed concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Personalized Insights:**\n",
    "   - By tracking and visualizing the distribution of user-mentioned conditions, the system can provide personalized insights into the user's mental health priorities and concerns.\n",
    "   - This enables a more tailored and empathetic response from the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Continuous Monitoring:**\n",
    "   - The periodic display of the graph ensures continuous monitoring of the user's mental health expressions.\n",
    "   - Trends and changes in the distribution of mentioned conditions over time can be observed, allowing for proactive responses and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Enhanced User-Centered Design:**\n",
    "   - Including a visual representation of user input aligns with a user-centered design approach in mental health systems.\n",
    "   - It acknowledges the importance of understanding the user's perspective and tailoring the system's responses to individual needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Support for Mental Health Professionals:**\n",
    "   - In a broader context, if integrated into a mental health support system, such visual analytics can provide valuable information to mental health professionals.\n",
    "   - Professionals can use this data to better understand user concerns, track the effectiveness of interventions, and make informed decisions in providing support.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Privacy and Sensitivity:**\n",
    "   - The system respects user privacy by only tracking conditions explicitly mentioned by the user. This ensures that the graph focuses on the user's intended sharing of mental health concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the graph feature adds a valuable layer of interaction and understanding to the mental health system. It enhances user engagement, provides personalized insights, and supports both users and professionals in fostering mental well-being. Additionally, it aligns with the broader trend of integrating technology and data analytics to improve mental health care and support.\n"
