## **Abstract**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental process in data science that allows analysts to explore data structures, detect anomalies, and identify relationships before applying complex models. This chapter explores various EDA techniques, including summary statistics, data visualizations, and feature engineering, to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

This chapter covers essential methods such as histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and box plots to visualize data distributions and detect outliers. Additionally, it discusses handling missing values, normalizing data, and addressing skewness using transformations like log scaling. The analysis is applied to a used car dataset, demonstrating how variables such as mileage, engine size, brand, and transmission type influence car prices.

Furthermore, this chapter emphasizes the significance of preprocessing, including categorical encoding and outlier handling, ensuring the dataset is clean and ready for modeling. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this chapter presents a structured approach to exploratory analysis. The findings reveal key insights into data patterns and provide recommendations for optimizing predictive models.

Through practical examples and structured methodology, this chapter highlights the indispensable role of EDA in data science and machine learning workflows, serving as a foundation for deeper statistical and predictive modeling techniques.

## Title: Exploring the Relationship Between Housing Features and Sale Price Using Data Science Techniques

### Research Question:

How do key housing features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and property condition influence the sale price of properties?
This analysis aims to identify significant correlations and outliers within the dataset, providing insights that can guide investment decisions and pricing strategies in the real estate market.

**Why this question is interesting and relevant:**
Understanding the factors that drive housing prices is a crucial part of both the real estate and data science industries. Analyzing features that influence pricing can help investors and policymakers make better decisions. This study specifically focuses on applying data science techniques to a housing dataset to uncover meaningful relationships, trends, and patterns that can provide actionable insights.

## Theory and Background

### Theoretical Foundation:

Real estate pricing is influenced by multiple factors, including the size of the property, its location, condition, and the number of amenities available. In this analysis, we focus on quantitative data such as area (square footage), number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as property condition indicators (e.g., whether the property is furnished or near a main road). These features are commonly believed to have a strong influence on property value.

Data science techniques, particularly exploratory data analysis (EDA) and outlier detection methods, help us understand how these features correlate with property prices. The relationship between housing features and sale price can be uncovered through techniques like correlation analysis, visualization, and outlier removal.

### Literature Review:

Past studies in real estate valuation have shown that properties with more square footage and amenities such as additional bedrooms and bathrooms tend to fetch higher prices. Similarly, properties located in prime areas or closer to schools or main roads often command a premium price. Outliers, or extreme values, in sale prices can distort analysis, making outlier removal an important step in ensuring that data analysis is accurate and reliable.

In the context of this analysis, we aim to build upon this body of knowledge by applying modern data science techniques to a real estate dataset.

## Problem Statement

### Problem Formulation:

Given a dataset of housing features, the problem is to identify the most significant features that influence sale price. Specifically, we need to:

- Examine the relationship between **area**, **bedrooms**, **bathrooms**, and other housing features with the **sale price**.
- Detect and handle any **outliers** that may distort analysis.
- Provide an accurate model for predicting sale prices based on these features.

### Input and Output Format:

**Input:** The dataset includes various features of the housing market such as area (square footage), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and property condition.

**Output:** A set of visualizations and statistical results that reveal the most important features affecting sale price and any identified outliers.

**Sample Inputs:**

- Area: 1500 sq. ft.
- Bedrooms: 3
- Bathrooms: 2
- Condition: Furnished
- Sale Price: $300,000

**Sample Outputs:**

- Correlation between area and sale price: Strong positive correlation.
- Outliers detected for properties priced higher than $1 million.

## Problem Analysis

### Constraints:

- The dataset includes both numeric and categorical features, so feature preprocessing is necessary for effective analysis.
- There is a risk of outliers distorting the results, especially in features like sale price.
- The analysis assumes that the relationship between housing features and sale prices is linear for simplicity, although more complex relationships could be explored in future work.

### Approach:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Start by handling missing data and ensuring all relevant features are present.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigate relationships between features and sale price using correlation analysis and visualization techniques.
3. **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Apply Z-score and IQR methods to remove outliers from features like sale price and area.
4. **Result Interpretation**: Analyze the correlations and provide insights into the factors affecting housing prices.

## Solution Explanation

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle any missing or inconsistent values in the dataset, ensuring that each feature is ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Use correlation heatmaps and scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and sale price.
3. **Outlier Removal**:
   - Use Z-score and IQR methods to detect and remove extreme outliers that could skew the results.
4. **Result Analysis**:
   - Identify the most important factors influencing sale price and discuss the implications for the housing market.

**Pseudocode**:

1. Load the dataset
2. Clean data (handle missing values, normalize features)
3. Perform EDA (visualize relationships, calculate correlations)
4. Apply outlier detection (Z-score, IQR)
5. Display cleaned data and analysis results

## Results and Data Analysis

### Results:

- **Square Footage** and **Sale Price** show a strong positive correlation, meaning larger homes tend to be more expensive.
- **Number of Bedrooms** and **Bathrooms** also have a positive relationship with sale price, indicating that homes with more amenities fetch higher prices.
- The **Area** feature was identified as the most significant predictor of sale price, followed by the number of bathrooms.
- Outliers were removed from the data, particularly properties with sale prices that were much higher than the rest of the dataset.

### Discussion:

By handling skewness and outliers, we were able to stabilize the data, improving the accuracy of our analysis. The correlations support previous findings in the real estate literature, where larger homes and those with more amenities generally have higher sale prices.

**Visualizations**:

- Correlation heatmap for identifying strong relationships between features.
- Scatter plots showing the relationship between area, bedrooms, and sale price.
